However, previous tests of this hypothesis have obtained mixed results. We suggest that females differ in the traits they find attractive. To test this proposition, we assessed female zebra finches' preferences for males banded with red or green plastic leg bands and then tested the sex allocation pattern of females paired with preferred and non-preferred males. Although most females preferred redbanded males, 34% of females consistently preferred green-banded males. The sex ratio at laying and hatching was not influenced by paternal preferred status. However, the fledging sex ratios differed between females paired with preferred and non-preferred males due to sex-biased chick mortality; sons of females paired with preferred males were born heavier and were more likely to survive than daughters. Our results indicate that female zebra finches show individual variation in their preferences for colour banded males, although females do not seem to adjust the offspring sex ratio in response to their mate's band colour. However, the differential posthatch mortality suggests females may differentially allocate resources into male and female eggs according to their individual mate preferences.

One of the most replicated experiments in behavioral ecology is the presumed manipulation of male attractiveness in zebra finches by adding red or green color bands. Red-banded males were found to have higher fitness than green-banded males, and most empirical evidence suggests that this effect is mediated by female mating preferences rather than by male-male competition. A recent study, however, reported that color bands affected male courtship rate and body mass independently of female behavior. If this effect was real, some earlier findings of female preferences and maternal effects on offspring traits could potentially be reinterpreted as being mediated indirectly via effects on male behavior. This new perspective seems appealing also in light of a growing interest in bi-directional feedback mechanisms between endocrinology and ornamentation. However, here we report four independent failures to replicate this effect of color bands on courtship rate and body mass. Combining this new experimental data with all the published evidence in a meta-analysis shows that color bands seem to affect neither male courtship rate (average effect size d = 0.02) nor male body mass (d = -0.07). The present case is a reminder that replication of experiments lies at the heart of distinguishing between real effects and false positive findings.  2012 Seguin, Forstmeier.","animal behavior;  animal experiment;  article;  body mass;  breeding;  color band;  controlled study;  courtship;  ecology;  effect size;  female;  finch;  male;  mate choice;  mathematical analysis;  nonhuman;  parameters;  physical attractiveness;  poephila castanotis;  social environment, Animals;  Body Weight;  Color;  Courtship;  Female;  Finches;  Male;  Mating Preference, Animal;  Sexual Behavior, Animal;  Social Behavior",NA,NA,"Kelly, C.D., Replicating empirical research in behavioral ecology: How and why it should be done but rarely ever is (2006) Quarterly Review of Biology, 81, pp. 221-236; Owens, I.P.F., Where is behavioural ecology going?

However, attractiveness is not a fixed trait. Previous work has shown that male birds can adjust the intensity of their courtship display in response to variation in female behaviour, but little is known about how males adjust their behaviour during mate choice in response to social feedback about their own attractiveness independent of their intrinsic quality. Such information may help to maximize the potential mating success of males. Here, we provide experimental evidence that the amount of attention given by male zebra finches to females is dependent upon the manipulated attractiveness of males. This demonstrates that, in this socially monogamous species of bird, attractiveness of males could be considered to be a social construct, at least partially determined via social feedback from females.  2010 Springer-Verlag.","behavioral ecology;  behavioral response;  experimental study;  mate choice;  monogamy;  passerine;  reproductive success, Aves;  Taeniopygia guttata","Natural Environment Research CouncilNatural Environment Research Council,NERC,NE/F016514/1",NA,"Burley, N.T., Foster, V.S., Variation in female choice of mates:Condition influences selectivity (2006) Anim Behav, 72, pp. 713-719; Burley, N., Krantzberg, G., Radman, P., Influence of colour-banding on the conspecific preferences of zebra finches (1982) Anim Behav, 30, pp. 444-455; Buston, P.M., Emlen, S.T., Cognitive processes underlying human mate choice:The relationship between self-perception and mate preference in Western society (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 100, pp. 8805-8810; Campbell, D.L.M., Hauber, M.E., The disassociation of visual and acoustic conspecific cues decreases discrimination by female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) (2009) J Comp Psychol, 123, pp. 310-315; Clayton, N.S., Mate choice and pair formation in Timor and Australian mainland zebra finches (1990) Anim Behav, 39, pp. 474-480; Collins, S.A., Male displays: Cause or effect of female preference?

The addition of artificial ornaments has been assumed to manipulate a females' perception of the male, rather than affecting intrinsic qualities of the male himself. Here, however, we reveal that the artificial band color worn by a male changes his body mass, condition, and courtship display rate. Males wearing red color bands in aviaries prior to mate-choice trials had a significantly higher song rate during trials than those wearing green color bands, alongside a significant increase in mass change and condition. Male song rate was found to significantly correlate with female preference alongside a female preference for red-banded males. However, male song rate in turn increased when female response was positive, suggesting a social feedback between the interacting birds. Our data suggest the presence of socially mediated feedback mechanisms whereby the artificial increase in attractiveness or dominance of a male directly affects other aspects of his attractiveness. Therefore, housing birds in social groups while manipulating attractiveness can directly influence other male qualities and should be accounted for by future studies.","behavioral response;  body condition;  body mass;  mate choice;  passerine, Aves;  Taeniopygia guttata",National Eye Research CentreNational Eye Research Centre,"Australian Research Council Discovery Project Grant DP0558434 to S.C.G, an NERC studentship to E.C.P., and a Macquarie University Research Excellence Scholarship to M.M.M.","Andersson, M., Female choice selects for extreme tail length in a widowbird (1982) Nature, 299, pp. 818-820; Balzer, A.L., Williams, T.D., Do female zebra finches vary primary reproductive effort in relation to mate attractiveness?

As the quality of an individual influences the payoffs associated with the actions it can perform, its appearance should also influence its behavior. Here we investigate whether male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, change their behavior (and their energetic states) after artificial manipulations of their appearance, using different colored leg bands, and if such effects carry over after the end of the manipulation, as might be expected if appearance-mediated social dynamics ""lock"" individuals into different states. During three experimental phases, in which all males in a group wore neutral colored leg bands at the beginning (phase I), then wore attractive, unattractive, and neutral colored bands, respectively (phase II), before wearing the neutral color again (phase III), we found no evidence of an effect of the appearance manipulation on state, weight or any behavioral traits we measured. Nevertheless, we found that individuals that stored more fat were more likely to initiate and win aggressive interactions but were less likely to be recipients of aggression. This association between energetic state and aggressive behavior is discussed from both strategic body mass regulation and sexual selection perspectives.

For instance, some birds are naturally sensitive to leg colour, with some colours being more visible or attractive than others. The colour of the leg-rings used to mark birds may thus be related to behavioural and reproductive variables. Most studies have investigated this effect for adults during reproduction, but leg-ring colour may also affect the behaviour of young birds. We tested the potential effect of leg-ring colours on the within-brood dominance hierarchy of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings while each brood formed a stable and exclusive family unit with its mother. Ducklings did not acquire a within-brood dominance rank according to the colour of their own ring. This result suggests that mallards may not have a sensory bias for a given colouration. However, ducklings wearing a ring of the same colour as one of the two rings of their mother were dominant over their siblings. We discuss the potential behavioural and methodological implications of this result.  2009 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, recent experimental studies revealed that social information can play a role in the evolution of mate preferences in monogamous species with biparental care. However, this phenomenon has been demonstrated only under particular conditions and the prevalence and importance of this phenomenon therefore remains to be evaluated. In particular, previous laboratory experiments have consisted in exposing test females to only one paired male at a time, while under natural conditions monogamous females are likely to observe the choice of several females before making a decision. Thus, in the present study, female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) could observe two model females simultaneously, that provided either inconsistent or consistent information, depending on whether they were interacting with different types of males or with males of a same phenotype. We found that the relative importance given to private and social information on females' preferences varied with the consistency of social information and females significantly changed their preference only when social information was consistent. There was, nevertheless, a large variation in their responses. We suggest that such variations could be due to the fact that the benefits of mate-choice copying are frequency-dependent, and that this constrain would further contribute to limit the use of social information in monogamous species.  2008 Springer-Verlag.","behavioral ecology;  bird;  evolutionary biology;  mate choice;  parental care;  phenotype;  plasticity, Taeniopygia guttata",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"Acknowledgments We thank Sophie St-Cyr for her assistance during the experiments, Nadia Aubin-Horth, Wolfgang Forstmeier and an anonymous referee for their constructive comments on a previous version of the manuscript.

Egg laying is costly for birds, as eggs must contain all the energy and nutrients needed by the developing embryo. As nutrients are limiting, there is a conflict between provisioning eggs and conserving nutrients for future health and survival. 2. Life-history theory suggests that females should choose how to invest resources in relation to the value of the reproductive attempt. Females may manipulate egg composition in relation to the attractiveness of their mate, ensuring chick survival and assuming that the offspring will themselves be more attractive and have higher reproductive success. Antioxidants are an important component of egg composition: they are vital for embryonic and posthatching chick development and survival. 3. Here we demonstrate that female Zebra Finches (Taeniopygia guttata) mated to attractive males deposit more carotenoids and alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) in later-laid eggs, shown by a significant interaction between laying order and antioxidant concentration. This bias may increase the probability of chick survival from later-laid eggs and potentially the lifetime reproductive success of the laying female. 4. The body condition of the laying female, measured as fat reserves, was found to be a significant predictor of yolk carotenoid concentration but not of yolk alpha-tocopherol concentration.  2006 British Ecological Society.","antioxidant;  carotenoid;  egg development;  energy;  maternal effect;  nutrient;  reproductive success;  survival;  vitamin, Aves;  Bias;  Taeniopygia guttata",NA,NA,"Andersson M, (1992) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press Princeton, NJ, USA; Bahr J, M., Wang, S.C., Huang, M.Y., Calvo, F.O., Steroid concentrations in isolated theca and granulosa layers of preovulatory follicles during the ovulatory cycle of the domestic hen (1983) Biology of Reproduction, 29, pp. 327-334; Blount J, D., Surai, P.F., Nager, R.G., Carotenoids and egg quality in the lesser black-backed gull Larus fuscus: A supplemental feeding study (2002) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B, 269, pp. 29-36; Blount J, D., Houston, D.C., Surai, P.F., Moller, A.P., Egg-laying capacity is limited by carotenoid pigment availability in wild gulls Larus fuscus (2004) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B, 271, pp. 71-S81; Burley N, The differential-allocation hypothesis: An experimental test (1988) American Naturalist, 132, pp. 611-628; Burley N, Krantzberg, G., Radman, P., Influence of colour-banding on the conspecific preferences of zebra finches (1982) Animal Behaviour, 30, pp. 444-455; Cunningham J, A.E., Russell, A.F., Egg investment is influenced by male attractiveness in the mallard (2000) Nature, 404, pp. 74-76; Feingold I, B., Longhurst, P.A., Colby, H.D., Regulation of adrenal and hepatic alpha-tocopherol content by androgens and estrogens (1993) Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1176, pp. 192-196; Gil D, Graves, J., Hazon, N., Wells, A., Mate attractiveness and differential testosterone investment in zebra finch eggs (1999) Science, 286, pp. 126-128; Gil D, Leboucher, G., Lacroix, A., Cue, R., Kreutzer, M., Female canaries produce eggs with greater amounts of testosterone when exposed to preferred male song (2004) Hormones and Behaviour, 45, pp. 64-70; Grafen A, Hails, R., (2002) Modern Statistics for the Life Sciences, , Oxford University Press Oxford, UK; Graves J, Whiten, A., Henzi, P., Why does the herring gull lay three eggs?

Mothers are predicted to invest differentially in offspring in ways that will maximize offspring fitness depending on the environment she expects them to encounter. Here, we test for maternal effects in response to mate attractiveness on offspring developmental traits in the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata. We controlled for parental genetic quality by manipulating male attractiveness using coloured leg rings and by randomly assigning mating pairs. The potential confounding effect of differential nestling care was controlled for by cross-fostering clutches and by allowing for variance due to foster father attractiveness in general linear models. We found a difference in egg mass investment between attractiveness groups and, importantly, we found that all of the offspring traits we measured varied with the attractiveness of the father. This provides strong evidence for maternal effects in response to mate attractiveness. Furthermore, due to the experiment design, we can conclude that these effects were mediated by differential investment of egg resources and not due to genetic differences or differences in nestling care.  2006 The Royal Society.","egg;  fitness;  male behavior;  maternal effect;  nestling;  parental investment;  passerine;  phenotype, animal behavior;  animal experiment;  article;  body size;  bone growth;  controlled study;  female;  genetic difference;  genetic manipulation;  genetic trait;  male;  nestling;  nonhuman;  oocyte development;  priority journal;  progeny;  sexual behavior;  sexual maturation;  sexuality;  survival;  zebra fish;  animal;  breeding;  color;  feeding behavior;  finch;  growth, development and aging;  histology;  oocyte;  physiology;  reproduction;  sexual behavior, Taeniopygia guttata, Animals;  Body Size;  Breeding;  Color;  Feeding Behavior;  Female;  Finches;  Male;  Ovum;  Reproduction;  Sexual Behavior, Animal",NA,NA,"Alekseev, V., Lampert, W., Maternal control of resting-egg production in Daphnia (2001) Nature, 414, pp. 899-901. , doi:10.1038/414899a; Balzer, A.L., Williams, T.D., Do female zebra finches vary in primary reproductive effort in relation to mate attractiveness?

In birds, parents have been shown to invest more into egg production and nestling care when paired with an attractive rather than an unattractive mate, as predicted by the differential allocation hypothesis. Here we investigate variation in the female's and male's share of incubation behaviour, a vital, and costly, period of parental care during which the embryo is vulnerable to perturbations in developmental conditions. We manipulated the attractiveness of male zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata, using red or green leg-rings. To simulate their natural social environment we allowed them to breed in outdoor aviaries. All males within an aviary were given the same coloured ring to avoid ring-colour related assortative mating. Males within a colony, however, were still expected to show some variation in attractiveness with the earliest laying females possibly pairing with the most attractive males. Indeed we found that both factors played a role in explaining female incubation effort. Among females mated to red ringed males, earlier laying females contributed significantly more to incubation than late laying females, but no such pattern was found in females mated to green ringed males. Overall, there were no differences in the level of incubation provided by both parents between treatment groups, suggesting some compensation within the pair. Hatching success was correlated with a pair's total incubation effort. These results suggest that variation in the division of parental care between the sexes is in agreement with both increased effort of females mated with attractive males, and females compensating for the reduced effort of attractive males seeking further mating opportunities. These two factors can act at the same time in natural populations and both should be considered when explaining variation in division of labour between the sexes.

Previous studies on zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, in which colored leg rings were used to alter male attractiveness, support this hypothesis. However, because molecular sexing techniques were not available, it was not known when during development this bias arose. Also, because both attractive (red-ringed) and unattractive (green-ringed) males were within the same aviary, assortative mating between treatments may have confounded the results. Using two different experimental designs, we tested whether the sex ratio of zebra finch eggs and chicks differed in response to paternal ring color whilst controlling for assortative mating between treatments. In the aviary experiment, birds could interact socially, but all males in an aviary had the same leg ring color. In the cage experiment, each female was randomly assigned a red- or green-ringed mate, thus also eliminating assortative mating within treatments. Offspring were sexed based on plumage or using a molecular method. The sex ratio at laying did not differ between treatments in either the aviary (n = 313 eggs) or cage (n = 151 eggs) experiments, suggesting that female zebra finches do not manipulate the primary sex ratio in response to their mate's ring color. However, in the cage experiment we found greater male embryonic mortality in the attractive group, which resulted in a female-biased sex ratio at sexual maturity, that is, in the opposite direction to that found in previous studies. Possible explanations for the disparity between our results and those of previous studies are considered.  The Author 2005.

If females acquire preferences through social mechanisms, sexual selection could act very rapidly to spread the preference and drive elaboration of the preferred trait (s). Although there are reports of 'mate-choice copying' in polygynous species, there is no clear evidence for this process in monogamous species. Here, we investigated whether adult female zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata can socially acquire sexual preferences for individual males and, in a separate study, for a generalized trait (coloured leg bands) of males. In both studies, test females observed males in two simultaneous conditions: a ('chosen') mixed-sex situation in which a male was paired with a (model) female, and a ('unchosen') same-sex situation in which a male was paired with another male. In the first experiment, after two weeks of females observing males, test females significantly preferred individual males who had been paired with another female (i.e. chosen males). In the second experiment, test females significantly preferred novel males that were wearing the same leg band colour as the apparently chosen males. Our findings are consistent with the conclusion that female zebra finches' mate preferences are altered by public information. Our study implies that mate preferences can spread rapidly through populations by social mechanisms, affecting the strength of sexual selection in a monogamous species.  2005 The Royal Society.","imitation;  mate choice;  monogamy;  passerine;  preference behavior;  social behavior, animal behavior;  animal experiment;  article;  bird;  breeding;  female;  male;  mating;  nonhuman;  priority journal;  sexual behavior;  sexual selection, Animalia;  Aves;  Taeniopygia guttata",NA,NA,"Agrawal, A.A., The evolutionary consequences of mate copying on male traits (2001) Behav.

Females are also predicted to invest more in sons than in daughters under such conditions, because male offspring should have higher fitness returns than female offspring when fathered by an attractive male. We examined primary resource allocation in zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, when mated to both an attractive and an unattractive male. In the first breeding round, as predicted, females mated to attractive males laid heavier eggs, and there was a positive relation between female mass and egg mass. In contrast, for females mated to unattractive males there was no correlation between egg mass and body mass. Mate attractiveness did not affect clutch size or yolk androgen investment. Unexpectedly, in the second breeding round, in which the same females were paired with different males of opposite attractiveness to those in the first round, females did not alter their individual patterns of investment in egg mass. Therefore, we suggest there may be a physiological carryover effect and that females were primed by their first reproductive experience. In both rounds of breeding there was no difference in egg mass or yolk androgen concentration between male or female eggs in either treatment. Similarly, the primary sex ratio did not differ between treatments. This suggests that females do not differentially invest in male and female offspring in relation to the attractiveness of their mate in this species.  2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Of 55 recaptures of 42 individuals, 22 (40%) had lost at leastone of its colour rings. Females showed a tendency to remove colour rings more frequently than males. For both sexes, there was a similar tendency to remove more dark than lightcoloured rings. While it is not possible to identify a specific reason why the birds remove their colour rings, it is possible that discomfort on the nest may play a role in ring removal by females and, more speculatively, it is possible that males might remove colour rings to manipulate their sexual attractiveness to females. Wraparound rings might provide a solution to the problem of colourringing species with powerful beaks.  2004 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","bird;  ringing, Aves;  Carduelis;  Carduelis chloris;  Chloris",NA,NA,"Bennett, A.T.D., Cuthill, I.C., Ultraviolet vision in birds: What is its function?

From a colour band experiment in the field, we have previously reported that male bluethroats, Luscinia s. svecica, with blue and orange bands (BO males) guarded their mates less intensely at the peak of female fertility, and spent more time advertising for additional mates, than males banded with non-BO colours. These responses indicated that BO males experienced less threat to their paternity than did non-BO males, possibly mediated through an increased attractiveness. Here we present paternity analyses of the broods from the field study and test whether there were differences between the two male groups in within-pair or extrapair paternity. There were no significant differences between the two groups of males in paternity, suggesting effective male protection of paternity. However, extrapair paternity was infrequent in the 2 years of the field experiment; hence, the power in detecting effects on paternity does not allow a definitive conclusion on this issue. We also conducted an aviary experiment in which females were given the choice between a BO male and a non-BO male, to test whether females had preferences for particular colour bands. Females did not associate more with BO males, as would have been expected if these males were more attractive in social mate choice. Our results suggest that the effects of colour bands on social mate choice and paternity are, at best, weak.

Females (N=10) were tested separately and moved freely between the chamber's arms, each of which contained a male wearing bands (two per leg) in symmetric; asymmetric or cross-asymmetric configurations. In three of the six tests experienced by each female, one-way glass (mounted diagonally within each arm) prevented males from seeing the female or their own reflection. During the other three tests, transparent glass was used, so males could see and react to the female. A male's band combination had a significant influence on the amount of time that females spent with him, but only during transparent-glass tests, where symmetric males were preferred. The results of our transparent-glass tests were similar to those reported by Swaddle and Cuthill (1994, Nature, 367, 165-166), in a study where females selected between males that were interacting with their own mirror images (reflected by one-way glass). We discuss why females display the same apparent preference when tested with males engaged in intra- (Swaddle and Cuthill's study) versus intersexual activities (our study). Since females in our study displayed a preference only when males could interact with them, caution may be required when extrapolating the results of static choice tests (e.g. involving models, one-way glass or video images) to situations where the participants can interact.","female behavior;  mate choice;  passerine, Fringillidae;  Passeriformes;  Taeniopygia guttata;  Taeniopygia guttata",University of WaikatoUniversity of Waikato,"We thank the Department of Biological Sciences and the University of Waikato for funding the research, and Professor Ray Littler (Statistics Department, University of Waikato) for conducting the statistical analysis.

Behavioural observations showed that the tutee associated more with the adult from which it was subsequently found to have learnt. In a second experiment, birds reared by both parents wearing either light-blue or light-green colour rings and then given a choice of tutors wearing these ring combinations also showed no preference between them. These young males did, however, more often approach the tutor ringed as their parents had been. This may explain why they did not show more interest in the tutor whose song they learnt. The majority of the tutors were used twice, with the ring colour swapped before they were used the second time. There was a strong tendency for the same male to be copied by the two young birds exposed to him. This could not be attributed to a difference in song rate between the two tutors.

In this study, I used a four-choice chamber apparatus to investigate this preference, and to determine whether it is influenced by band coloration. I created band combinations by banding males with four leg bands. The symmetrical combinations consisted of two bands on each leg; the asymmetrical combinations consisted of three bands on one leg and one band on the other leg. For each of the symmetry treatments, all four bands were either light green or red. Females did not spend significantly more time associating with males wearing symmetrical bands or with males wearing red bands. The duration of male-female associations was not influenced by an interaction between symmetry category and band colour treatment. None of 10 females spent the most time with males with red symmetrical bands.","leg band;  symmetry;  zebra finch, Fringillidae;  Passeriformes;  Taeniopygia guttata;  Taeniopygia guttata;  Taeniopygia guttata",NA,"I thank M.

Biology, Inst. of Biomed. and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, United Kingdom","Zebra finches have previously been found to have preferences for particular colours of both natural and artificial traits among opposite sex conspecifics. For example, in some studies female zebra finches preferred males wearing red leg bands to orange-banded and unbanded birds and rejected light green-banded males. In other studies, females also preferred males with red beaks to orange-beaked males. However, several authors have failed to replicate these results. We show that females may fail to show a colour preference because of the absence or removal of ultraviolet light under experimental conditions. In mate-choice trials, females observing males through filters that transmitted ultraviolet preferred red-banded males but where females viewed males through ultraviolet-blocking filters, no such preference was observed. Further investigation revealed that the lack of a colour preference when ultraviolet was absent was probably due to the change in overall appearance of the bird, rather than the change in appearance of the rings themselves. This work highlights the importance of proper consideration of the sensory capabilities of animals in experimental design, particularly with regard to the role of ultraviolet light in avian colour perception.",Animalia;  Aves;  Fringillidae;  Galliformes;  Taeniopygia guttata;  Taeniopygia guttata,7/S05042,"We are very grateful to Julian Partridge, Ron Douglas, Justin Marshall and Sarah Collins for discussions and for the loan of equipment, to Sadie Iles and Rob Massie for animal care and two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

One explanation is that colour-matching with a sexual ornament affects the individual's sexual attractiveness. This study reports a colour-band experiment with free-living bluethroats, Luscinia s. svecica, a species where males have a distinct blue and chestnut throat and upper breast. There was no apparent difference in pairing success between males with ornament-matching colour bands (blue and orange) and males with non-ornamental colour bands. However, males with ornamental bands guarded their mates less intensely and spent more time singing, performing song flights and intruding into neighbours' territories than males with non-ornamental bands. We conclude that colour bands affect the trade-off between mate guarding and advertisement behaviour in a way that is consistent with the hypothesis that bands with ornamental colours improve a male's attractiveness. The results are in concordance with a previous study of the same population, showing that males with experimentally reduced attractiveness guarded their mates more closely and advertised less for additional mates, than non-manipulated males.","attractiveness;  bluethroat;  leg band;  mate guarding;  ornament, Aves;  Luscinia;  Luscinia svecica;  Luscinia svecica svecica;  Luscinia svecica svecica",Norges ForskningsrdNorges Forskningsrd,"We thank Trond Amundsen, Peder Fiske, the Behavioural Ecology group at the Zoological Museum in Oslo and two anonymous referees for discussions and/or comments on the manuscript, StaVan Andersson and Jonas O} rnborg for doing the spectroradiometrical measurements and Hkon rjaster for assistance in the field.

Prior to the experiment, each male founder was fitted with either two red bands (creating a phenotype previously demonstrated to be attractive to females) or two green bands (unattractive to females) as part of a unique combination of four leg bands. The overall paternal exclusion rate was 28%, as determined by multilocus, minisatellite DNA fingerprinting of 278 offspring reared by 26 males and their mates. Mean exclusion rates were 16% and 40% for red- and green-banded males, respectively. Exclusion rates were directly proportional to rates of female participation in unforced extrapair copulations (UEPCs) with red-banded males that occurred when females were fertile. Rates of fertile, forced extrapair copulations (FEPCs) and fertile UEPCs involving green-banded males either failed to influence exclusion rate or varied inversely with exclusion rate, indicating that extrapair fertilization (EPF) is under female control. Effort devoted by males to seeking EPFs increased exclusion rate. Results suggest that males place greater effort into seeking fertile versus infertile EPCs and that unattractive males accrue fitness gains through high parental investment (PI), whereas attractive males benefit through decreased PI and increased allocation to EPF.","extra-pair fertilization;  sexual selection;  zebra finch, Estrildidae;  Taeniopygia guttata",NA,NA,"Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior: Sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-265; Birkhead, T.R., Burke, T., Zann, R.A., Hunter, F.M., Krupa, A.P., Extrapair paternity and intraspecific brood parasitism in wild zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, revealed by DNA fingerprinting (1990) Behav Ecol Sociobiol, 27, pp. 315-324; Birkhead, T.R., Hunter, F.M., Pellatt, J.E., Sperm competition in the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata (1989) Anim Behav, 38, pp. 935-950; Birkhead, T.R., Mller, A.P., (1992) Sperm Competition in Birds: Evolutionary Causes and Consequences, , London: Academic Press; Burley, N., The organization of behavior and the evolution of sexually selected traits (1985) Avian Monogamy, pp. 22-44. , (Gowaty PA, Mock DW, eds).

Experimental evidence indicates that in mate choice situations individuals possessing symmetric arbitrary traits or symmetric secondary sexual characters are preferred over those with larger asymmetries. This experiment investigated the effect of symmetric and asymmetric arbitrary traits (arrangements of coloured leg-bands) on reproductive success in captive zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata. Six groups of six males and six females were separated into six free-flight breeding aviaries. Nestboxes and nesting material were freely available throughout the experiment. Males wore symmetric and asymmetric arrangements of the same coloured leg-bands. Each male wore two orange and two light green bands, two on each leg. There were six possible arrangements of these leg-bands. One male from each of these six leg-band treatments was present in each aviary, along with six females wearing numbered orange bands. Symmetrically banded males produced more offspring that survived past the period of parental care than males in either of the asymmetric treatments; this appeared to be the effect of female choice processes and female-based parental investment and not male intra-sexual dominance. This is the first experiment to indicate that symmetrically manipulated males gain reproductive advantages in controlled laboratory conditions and further supports recent theories indicating the evolutionary importance of symmetry in signalling-trait design.  1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","fluctuating asymmetry;  parental investment;  reproductive success;  sexual selection;  zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata",NA,"I thank Innes Cuthill, Mark Witter and Rowan Lockwood for helpful discussion concerning experimental design and for inciteful discussion; Tim Guilford and two anonymous referees for their comments on an early version of the manuscript; Anders Mller for access to unpublished manuscripts; and Rob Massie and Sadie Iles for routine daily maintenance of the birds.

T6G 2E9, Canada","Willow ptarmigan, Lagopus lagopus, possess red supra-orbital combs. If this secondary sexual structure is important in attracting mates or in male-male competition, then colour banding males with red or orange bands (RO) could influence their pairing and reproductive success, survival and the amount of aggression directed towards them. Males with RO bands did not have more mates than those without RO bands, nor did males unbanded in year x improve their pairing success in year x + 1 when they were given RO bands. In a female removal experiment, males with RO bands did not have more females settling on their territories than males with other band colours. Number of chicks fledged from successful nests and annual survival did not differ for RO and non-RO males. Monogamous and polygynous males had similar comb areas which were larger than the combs of unmated males. When pairing statys was controlled, comb area was not related to annual survival or number of chicks fledged. Males with RO bands did not have larger combs than non-RO males. Area of comb was correlated with territory size in years of high breeding density, but not in years of low breeding density. Radiotagged non-territorial males did not preferentially intrude upon the territories of males with RO bands and song rates, number of border disputes, mean length of border disputes, and territorial intrusion rates did not differ significantly for RO and non-RO males. These results suggest that colour-banding willow ptarmigan with red colour bands does not have a negative or positive effect on reproductive success or survival, and thus the data do not support the coverable badge hypothesis.  1995.","badge size;  comb display;  reproductive success;  willow ptarmigan, Lagopus lagopus",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"We thank the many assistants who have assisted us over the years, especially J.

Such asymmetries are believed to be a direct indicator of phenotypic, perhaps genotypic, quality2. Relative levels of asymmetry are much greater in secondary sexual characters than in normal morphological traits2. It has been proposed that females use the amount of asymmetry in secondary sexual ornamentation as a cue in mate choice3, because the highest quality individuals have the most symmetrical, as well as elaborate, ornaments2-10. Using a choice chamber similar to that in ref. 11, we show here that female zebra finches choose symmetrically leg-banded males over asymmetrically banded ones. This demonstrates unequivocally that females use symmetry as a criterion in partner preference, although whether the symmetry preference is specific to secondary sexual characters is unknown.  1994 Nature Publishing Group.","fluctuating asymmetry;  male choice;  sexual ornamentation;  zebra finch, Fringillidae;  Taeniopygia guttata, animal experiment;  article;  assortative mating;  bird;  female;  male;  mating;  morphology;  nonhuman;  priority journal;  sexual behavior",NA,NA,"Ludwig, W., (1932) Das Rechts-Links Problem im Tiereich und beim Menschen, , (Springer, Berlin); Mller, A.P., Pomiankowski, A., Genetica; Meller, A.P., (1992) Nature, 357, pp. 238-240; Manning, J.T., Hartley, M.A., (1991) Anim.

In the first experiment, females were allowed to choose among four naturally varying males. In the second, females chose among four males wearing either orange, blue, yellow, or no color bands. In experiment 1, females performed more courtship with males that had significantly brighter bills and were brighter overall. In experiment 2, females preferred males wearing orange bands over unhanded males. Blue-banded males ranked second and yellow third, but neither was preferred significantly more often than the unbanded males. A female's preference for a particular band color was weakly associated with her own bill and plumage measures; females with brighter throat feathers and yellower bills preferred orange bands to blue bands. The results suggest that female preferences for orange and yellow may be functional and that females may also have aesthetic preferences.  1993 International Society for Behavioral Ecology.","American goldfinch;  colour;  mate preference, Carduelis tristis","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation,BSR-8800218","We thank the following people for their help in various phases of the project: J.Alster, B.

They received either all red bands (to match their epaulets) or all black bands (controls). Over half the red-banded males lost their territories while all black-banded males retained their territories. Red and black-banded males did not differ morphologically. However, among red-banded males, those that lost their territories had larger epaulets and were in poorer condition than those retaining their territories. Red-banded males suffered much higher intrusion rates, particularly by neighbors, than black-banded males. We propose that red color bands exaggerated the males' natural aggressive signal beyond the point where the signal was reliable.

They find certain colours more attractive, and others less attractive, than the natural unbanded condition. Females prefer red-banded males over unbanded ones, and avoid light-blue and light-green banded males. Males prefer black and pink banded females and avoid those wearing light-blue or light-green bands. These findings may have utility for the study of mate choice in monogramous species; they also raise important questions about a widely used experimental technique.  1982.",NA,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"We thank V6ronique Delesalle, Martha McClure, Suzanne Donovan and Richard Szymanski for assistance at various stages of the research.
