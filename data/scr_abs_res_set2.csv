I tested 4 hypotheses about the relationship between female investment and social mate attractiveness by manipulating a sexually selected trait, white tail feathers (""tail white""), in male Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis thurberi): (1) the differential allocation hypothesis predicts that females optimize lifetime reproductive success by maximizing parental investment in the offspring of ornamented mates and minimizing investment when mated to less attractive males; (2) instead of positive differential allocation, females could show negative differential allocation by investing more in less attractive males to compensate for their lower quality; (3) female care could also be influenced directly by paternal investment, in particular what appears to be positive differential allocation could be compensation for reduced care by attractive males; or (4) females could reduce care when paired with socially attractive males that are ""good parents"". To evaluate these hypotheses, I examined the impact of tail white manipulation on clutch size, female incubation and brooding, and female and male provisioning. Females did not differentially allocate in relation to social mate attractiveness, nor were females responsive to patterns of male investment, even although artificially attractive males provisioned offspring significantly more than did controls. Naturally bright males, who were also the largest males, did not provision at higher rates, highlighting the need to experimentally separate the role of specific traits from other correlated factors. Tail white-manipulated males were involved in rare cases of polygyny and at times were actively guarded by their mates. Together, these results suggest that tail white influences reproductive behaviors in this junco population, but because of the potential for extrapair paternity, additional data are needed to accurately investigate the trait's role in female investment.

We tested eye use by zebra finches to view a model predator, a monitor lizard, and compared this to eye use to view a non-threatening visual stimulus, a jar. We used a modified method of scoring eye preference of zebra finches, since they often alternate fixation of a stimulus with the lateral, monocular visual field of one eye and then the other, known as biocular alternating fixation. We found a significant and consistent preference to view the lizard using the left lateral visual field, and no significant eye preference to view the jar. This finding is consistent with specialisation of the left eye system, and right hemisphere, to attend and respond to predators, as found in two other avian species and also in non-avian vertebrates. Our results were considered together with hemispheric differences in the zebra finch for processing, producing, and learning song, and with evidence of right-eye preference in visual searching and courtship behaviour. We conclude that the zebra finch brain has the same general pattern of asymmetry for visual processing as found in other vertebrates and suggest that, contrary to earlier indications from research on lateralisation of song, this may also be the case for auditory processing.  2018 by the authors.",NA,"20738994","English","Article","Scopus","679","University of New EnglandUniversity of New England","Funding: The project was funded by The Cardigan Fund, an annual bequest to G.K.

This differential allocation (DA) is highly dependent on exactly how partner quality affects reproductive costs and offspring benefits. We present a stochastic dynamic model of DA in which females care for a series of clutches when mated with males of different quality. In each reproductive event, females choose the size and number of offspring. We find that if partner quality affects reproductive costs, then DA in total reproductive investment occurs only via changes in the number of offspring. DA in the optimal size of the offspring occurs only if partner quality affects the offspring benefit function. This is mostly in the form of greater female investment per offspring as male quality decreases. Simultaneously, we find that adaptive DA increases the number of offspring, and thus the amount of total investment, as male quality increases. Only certain model scenarios produce the positive DA in offspring size seen in empirical studies, providing a predictive framework for DA and how partner quality affects reproductive costs and offspring benefits.  2018 The Authors.

In species with biparental care, mutual mate choice is expected to result in assortative mating for quality. When assortment is not perfect, the lower quality pair members are expected to compensate by increased parental investment to secure their partner (positive differential allocation). This framework has been assumed to hold for monogamous species like the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), but progress has been hampered by the difficulty to define individual quality. By combining multiple measures of causes (inbreeding, early nutrition) and consequences (ornaments, displays, fitness components) of variation in quality into a single principal component, we here show that quality variation can be quantified successfully. We further show that variation in quality indeed predicts individual pairing success, presumably because it reflects an individual's vigor or ability to invest in reproduction. However, despite high statistical power, we found no evidence for either assortative mating or for positive differential allocation. We suggest that zebra finch ornaments and displays are not sufficiently reliable for the benefits of choosiness to exceed the costs of competition for the putative best partner. To assess the generality of these findings unbiased quantification of signal honesty and preference strength is required, rather than selective reporting of significant results.  2017 The Author(s).

A lack of theoretical treatments has led to some confusion in the interpretation of DA in the empirical literature. We present a formal framework for DA that highlights the nature of reproductive benefits versus costs for females mated to males of different quality. Contrary to popular belief, analytical and stochastic dynamic models both show that additive benefits of male quality on offspring fitness have no effect on optimal levels of female investment and thus cannot produce DA. Instead, if offspring fitness is affected multiplicatively by male quality, or male quality affects the female cost function, DA is expected because of changes in the marginal benefits or costs of extra investment. Additive male quality effects on the female cost function can cause a novel form of weak DA, because reduced costs can slightly favor current over future reproduction. Combinations of these distinct effects in more realistic model scenarios can explain various patterns of positive and negative DA reported for different species and mating systems. Our model therefore sheds new light on the diversity of empirical results by providing a strong conceptual framework for the DA hypothesis.  2017 by The University of Chicago.","compensation;  conceptual framework;  female;  fitness;  life history trait;  male;  mate choice;  maternal effect;  parental investment;  paternal effect;  reproductive cost;  reproductive strategy;  resource allocation;  sexual selection, animal;  female;  male;  parent;  reproduction;  sexual behavior, Animals;  Female;  Male;  Parents;  Reproduction;  Sexual Behavior, Animal","00030147","English","Article","Scopus",NA,"240008,223257","We thank A.

However, we still know only little about how colour vision changes between different viewing conditions. This limits the understanding of how colour signalling is configured in habitats where the light of the illumination and the background may shift dramatically. I examined how colour discrimination in zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) is affected by adaptation to different backgrounds. I trained finches in a two-alternative choice task, to choose between red discs displayed on backgrounds with di fferent colours. I found that discrimination thresholds correlate with stimulus contrast to the background. Thresholds are low, and in agreement with model predictions, for a background with a red colour similar to the discs. For the most contrasting green background, thresholds are about five times higher than this. Subsequently, I trained the finches for the detection of single discs on a grey background. Detection thresholds are about 2.5 to 3 times higher than discrimination thresholds. This study demonstrates close similarities in human and bird colour vision, and the quantitative data offer a new possibility to account for shifting viewing conditions in colour vision models.  2016 The Authors.",NA,"20545703","English","Article","Scopus","160383",NA,NA,NA,"Rowe, L., Houle, D., The lek paradox and the capture of genetic variance by condition dependent traits (1996) Proc.R.Soc.Lond., pp. 1415-1421; Delhey, K., Peters, A., Quantifying variability of avian colours: Are signalling traits more variable?

A recently revised version of the DAH makes explicit that investment can be positive, i.e. higher for the offspring of attractive males which should be of higher quality, or negative, i.e. higher for offspring of unattractive males, for example compensating for inheriting poor paternal genes. Moreover, investment can be made by the father and the mother. Here, we tested whether experimental manipulation of male attractiveness affected parental investment at different reproductive stages and thus influenced fitness-related traits in offspring. In two aviaries, all male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, were given red leg rings to increase attractiveness and in two aviaries all males received green leg rings to decrease attractiveness. This controlled for assortative mating between treatments. Ring colour was merely an experimental manipulation of male attractiveness, not paternal quality, so we might expect additional investment to elevate offspring quality. Eggs were cross-fostered between and within treatments to allow differentiation of effects of investment in eggs and nestlings. Clutch and brood sizes were standardized. Both positive and negative investment were observed: Eggs from red-ringed fathers had higher yolk to albumen ratios than eggs from green-ringed fathers. Nestlings from eggs laid and incubated by parents in the red-ringed group had higher hatching masses than those in the green-ringed group. Both parents in the green-ringed group fed nestlings more frequently than red-ringed parents. Offspring performance was influenced by the treatment of both foster and biological parents, but combined effects of these different investment patterns on fitness-related traits were ambiguous. Male attractiveness appeared to affect patterns of reproductive investment but not consistently across all forms of reproductive investment suggesting that the costs and benefits of differential allocation vary among individuals and across contexts.  2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","androgen;  brood size;  clutch size;  cost-benefit analysis;  fitness;  incubation;  life history trait;  maternal effect;  nestling;  parental investment;  paternal effect;  resource allocation, Taeniopygia guttata","00033472","English","Article","Scopus",NA,"Natural Environment Research CouncilNatural Environment Research Council","We thank Graham Law, Paul McGowan, Davina Graham, John Laurie, Kat Fellerman and Alister Kirk for caring for the birds; the Electronic Workshop for assistance with the video equipment.

Differential allocation of maternal resources, in terms of egg weight and yolk composition, may therefore allow the female to adjust brood reduction and to fine-tune reproductive investment in accordance with the expected fitness returns. The adaptive value of such maternal resource allocation is thought to be context-dependent as well as species-specific. We investigated the effects of female preference for her mate on the allocation of prenatal maternal resources in the budgerigar, Melopsittacus undulatus, a monogamous species of parrot that shows an extreme hatching asynchrony. We assessed mate preferences in a two-way preference test and allowed females two breeding rounds: one with the preferred and one with the non-preferred partner. We found no effect of preference on either latency to lay or clutch size, but females mated with the preferred partner laid eggs that contained significantly more yolk. Their eggs also contained significantly more androstenedione but not testosterone. Our results suggest that in this species, female preference may influence maternal resource allocation, and that the functional roles of each androgen in the yolk should be considered separately. In addition, we found a significant effect of laying order on egg and yolk weight as well as on yolk testosterone and androstenedione levels. These measures, however, did not change linearly with the laying order and render it unlikely that female budgerigars compensate for the extreme hatching asynchrony by adjusting within-clutch allocation of prenatal maternal resources.  2015 Elsevier Inc..","androgen;  androstenedione;  testosterone;  androstenedione;  testosterone, animal behavior;  animal experiment;  Article;  breeding;  breeding success;  budgerigar;  clutch size;  egg laying;  egg size;  egg yolk;  embryo;  female;  hatching;  hormone determination;  hormone synthesis;  male;  mate choice;  nonhuman;  priority journal;  animal;  budgerigar;  mate choice;  maternal behavior;  metabolism;  oocyte;  physiology;  sexual behavior, Androstenedione;  Animals;  Clutch Size;  Egg Yolk;  Female;  Male;  Maternal Behavior;  Mating Preference, Animal;  Melopsittacus;  Ovum;  Sexual Behavior, Animal;  Testosterone","0018506X","English","Article","Scopus",NA,"Fonds Wetenschappelijk OnderzoekFonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek","We thank Peter Scheys and Geert Eens for taking care of the birds.

There is indeed mounting evidence for a phenotypic covariation, also in the canary (Serinus canaria), our model species. Such covariation may arise due to maternal effects, rendering this relationship particularly sensitive to environmental conditions. Here, we manipulated the social environment by pairing females with either their chosen or non-chosen male. Subsequently, all clutches were cross-fostered to separate pre- and postnatal effects. We found a positive covariation between offspring begging and parental provisioning, which was, however, unaffected by mate preferences, and we found no evidence for differential allocation. In addition, there was no effect of assortative mating, which is thought to reinforce parent-offspring covariation. The fact that parent-offspring covariation is consistently observed in canaries suggests that it is biologically relevant, but it requires further studies to elucidate its sensitivity to environmental variation.  2015 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","Serinus canaria","00057959","English","Article","Scopus",NA,"Fonds Wetenschappelijk OnderzoekFonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek,FWO,1151211N",NA,NA,"Agrawal, A.F., Brodie, E.D., Brown, J., Parent-offspring coadaptation and the dual genetic control of maternal care (2001) Science, 292, pp. 1710-1712; Bengtsson, H., Rydn, O., Parental feeding rate in relation to begging behavior in asynchronously hatched broods of the great tit Parus major (1983) Behav.

A perspective by Hauber etal. (2014) Ethology describes advantages of this approach and highlights the use of model bird eggs and artificial egg coloration in research on egg rejection in the context of brood parasitism. Here, as a companion piece focused on quality control, I outline limitations and pitfalls associated with the use of artificial stimuli. In general, the practice makes assumptions about the perception and cognition of the study organism, therefore involving what could be called an umwelt gamble. The magnitude of this gamble and the prospects for interpretable results depend on the experimental design, the particular stimulus, and its intended role. Common roles are (1) as a representative stimulus to be generalized to a broader class; (2) as a substitute for a natural stimulus; (3) as a modification or exaggeration of natural stimuli; or (4) as an entirely novel stimulus. Whether the gamble is successful-whether the methodology navigates peculiarities of the study organism in the way the researchers intend-can be tested with controls that function as artifact detection tests. Given the propensity of animals to be biased, sometimes in unforeseen ways, in the way they perceive and interpret their environments, researchers should be careful when considering the use of artificial stimuli, weighing the advantages against the risks in any particular case.  2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","behavioral response;  bird;  brood parasitism;  cognition;  egg rejection;  environmental cue;  perception;  quality control, Animalia;  Aves","01791613","English","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bennett, A.T.D., Thry, M., Avian color vision and coloration: multidisciplinary evolutionary biology (2007) Am.

Species such as the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) may evolve the flexible use of alternative reproductive strategies, as well as benefit from prior breeding experience, which allows them to adaptively respond to unpredictable environments. In birds, the flexible use of alternative reproductive strategies, such as extra-pair mating, has been reported to be associated with fast reproduction, high mortality and environmental variability. However, little is known about the role of previous breeding experience in the adaptive use of alternative reproductive strategies. Here we performed an in-depth study of reproductive outcomes in a population of domesticated zebra finches, testing the impact of prior breeding experience on the use of alternative reproductive strategies and reproductive success. We provide evidence that older females with prior breeding experience are quicker to initiate a clutch with a new partner and have increased success in chick rearing, even in a captive colony of zebra finches with minimal foraging demands. We also find evidence that the breeding experience of other females in the same social group influences reproductive investment by female zebra finches. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the use of alternative reproductive strategies in female zebra finches is associated with previous failed breeding attempts with the same pair partner. The results provide evidence that age and breeding experience play important roles in the flexible use of both facultative and adaptive reproductive strategies in female zebra finches.  2014 Baran, Adkins-Regan.","adaptive behavior;  adult;  animal experiment;  article;  breeding success;  chick;  clutch size;  controlled study;  domestic animal;  embryo;  female;  foraging behavior;  genotype;  heterozygosity;  male;  nesting;  nonhuman;  organism colony;  paternity;  rearing;  reproductive success;  social environment;  Taeniopygia guttata, Animals;  Breeding;  Female;  Finches;  Male;  Pair Bond;  Reproduction;  Sexual Behavior, Animal","19326203","English","Article","Scopus","e89808",NA,NA,NA,"Bennett, P., Owens, I.P.F., (2002) Evolutionary Ecology of Birds: Life Histories, Mating Systems, and Extinction, p. 296. , Oxford University Press, USA; Owens, I.P.F., Hartley, I.R., Sexual dimorphism in birds: Why are there so many different forms of dimorphism?

Recent theory motivated by these intriguing empirical patterns predicted both positive (differential allocation) and negative (reproductive compensation) effects of mating with a preferred male on female investment. These predictions, however, focused on total reproductive effort and did not distinguish between a response in offspring size and clutch size. Here, we model how specific paternal effects on fitness affect maternal allocation to offspring size and number. The specific mechanism by which males affect the fitness of females or their offspring determines whether and how females allocated differentially. Offspring size is predicted to increase when males benefit offspring survival, but decrease when males increase offspring growth rate. Clutch size is predicted to increase when males contribute to female resources (e.g. with a nuptial gift) and when males increase offspring growth rate. The predicted direction and magnitude of female responses vary with female age, but only when per-offspring paternal benefits decline with clutch size.We conclude that considering specific paternal effects on fitness in the context of maternal life-history trade-offs can help explain mixed empirical patterns of differential allocation and reproductive compensation.  2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

To test this hypothesis, we conducted a study with wild-derived house mice (Mus musculus musculus) in which females were experimentally mated either with their preferred or non-preferred male, and their offspring were infected with a mouse pathogen, Salmonella enterica (serovar Typhimurium). Results: We found that offspring sired by preferred males were significantly more likely to survive the experimental infection compared to those sired by non-preferred males. We found no significant differences in the pathogen clearance or infection dynamics between the infected mice, suggesting that offspring from preferred males were better able to cope with infection and had improved tolerance rather than immune resistance. Conclusion: Our results provide the first direct experimental evidence within a single study that partner preferences enhance offspring resistance to infectious diseases.  2014 Raveh et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","animal;  animal salmonellosis;  article;  disease resistance;  female;  immunology;  male;  mate choice;  microbiology;  mouse;  pedigree;  physiology;  Salmonella typhimurium;  survival, Animals;  Disease Resistance;  Female;  Male;  Mating Preference, Animal;  Mice;  Pedigree;  Salmonella Infections, Animal;  Salmonella typhimurium;  Survival Analysis","14712148","English","Article","Scopus","14",NA,NA,NA,"Clutton-Brock, T., McAuliffe, K., Female mate choice in mammals (2009) Q Rev Biol, 84, pp. 3-27. , 10.1086/596461 19326786; Jennions, M.D., Petrie, M., Why do females mate multiply?

Here we experimentally investigate whether female reproductive behaviour is different when paired with a preferred or a non-preferred male in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). First, we assessed female mating preferences using a four-way choice apparatus, then females were caged together with either their preferred or least-preferred male. Female reproductive motivation, assessed by the propensity of laying eggs within two weeks from pairing and clutch mass, did not differ between the two experimental groups. Females responded to mate removal by either increasing their care, so as to compensate for the lost care of their mate, or by significantly reducing incubation. This bimodal response was not explained by mate preference, nevertheless, we found that females with lower baseline (i.e., pre-manipulation) incubation effort were more likely to cease incubation during mate removal. Taken together, we found no evidence that female reproductive behaviour varies along with mate preference.","Taeniopygia guttata","00057959","English","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Barta, Z., Houston, A.I., McNamara, J.M., Szkely, T., Sexual conflict about parental care: The role of reserves (2002) Am.

In waterfowl, reproductive, investment increased when captive female mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were mated to more attractive males, but information for wild ducks is lacking. Studies of waterfowl mating systems have focused primarily on the importance of plumage coloration of males and female mate choice, whereas investigations of reproductive ecology examine female attributes and virtually ignore the role of males in investment decisions. Here, we used unique data for 253 pairs of wild mallards to test whether females mated to high-quality males would increase reproductive effort and reproduce more successfully. We derived measurements of female and male body size and condition, and indices of male plumage quality, and related these traits to patterns of reproductive effort and performance of females. Consistent with predictions, yearling females nested earlier and had higher nest survival when mated to males with better plumage scores. Furthermore, when paired with larger bodied males, yearling females renested more often, and nest and brood survival increased among older females. Although the strength of male effects varied with breeding stage and female age or experience, this is one of a few studies to demonstrate an additive effect of male quality on investment and success of females, in free-ranging birds.  2013 Elsevier B.V.","assortative mating;  avifauna;  body condition;  body size;  captive population;  mate choice;  plumage;  reproductive cost;  reproductive effort;  resource allocation;  survival;  waterfowl;  wild population, animal behavior;  animal experiment;  article;  assortative mating;  bird;  body size;  controlled study;  ducks and geese;  female;  male;  mallard;  mating system;  measurement;  nest predation;  nonhuman;  reproductive effort;  survival rate;  yearling, Anas platyrhychos;  Assortative mating;  Individual quality;  Mallard;  Plumage quality;  Reproductive effort, Animals;  Ducks;  Female;  Male;  Mating Preference, Animal;  Reproduction","03766357","English","Article","Scopus",NA,"Environment CanadaEnvironment Canada","This research was supported by the Institute for Wetland and Waterfowl Research of Ducks Unlimited Canada; the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada; University of Saskatchewan; Environment Canada; and, the California Waterfowl Association .

Adaptive explanations for mate guarding have tended to focus on fitness consequences for males, but mate guarding and participation in being guarded is also likely adaptive for females in certain contexts. To better understand the adaptive explanations for mate guarding as well as the observed variation in paternity patterns, it is necessary to explore the relative costs and benefits of guarding (and being guarded) from both the male and female perspective. To investigate these costs and benefits, we conducted an experiment with the Australian zebra finch (Teniopygia guttata) in which we independently varied the perceived opportunity for each member of a captive breeding pair to engage in extra-pair copulation (EPC) solicitation behavior; as an individual's EPC opportunity increased, the partner's EPC opportunity remained constant. Our results indicate that, for males, mate guarding intensity increases when their female's EPC opportunity increases but decreases when their own (i.e., male) EPC opportunity increases. We did not find evidence of flexible female guarding behavior, but we found that females do not evade their partners more as female EPC opportunity increases.  2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","experimental study;  fitness;  mammal;  mate guarding;  paternity;  reproductive cost, Australia, Aves;  Taeniopygia guttata","03405443","English","Article","Scopus",NA,"EF-0436318","Acknowledgments We thank Lydia Wright-Jackson for assistance with animal care and Tom Meijer for constructing the experimental chamber.

In male birds, vocalizations are known to increase their attractiveness and consequently their probability of copulation. Moreover, male songs have been shown to shape maternal investment, particularly with regard to egg quality. Artificial manipulation of male attractiveness has been found to affect female sexual preferences and maternal investment. In this regard, supranormal stimuli are thought to increase such responses. The present study was designed to assess whether supranormal acoustic stimuli, known to induce high levels of sexual responsiveness in female canaries, Serinus canaria, could increase maternal investment beyond levels observed in birds exposed to natural songs. Exposure to supranormal songs (G phrases) increased maternal investment: compared to females exposed to moderately attractive (Control) or naturally attractive (A) phrases. Females exposed to supranormal songs laid bigger eggs (egg volume and mass, albumen mass); moreover, females in the G group laid eggs with heavier yolks than females in the Control group. In contrast, no differences were found between groups with regard to testosterone deposition in the eggs. Thus, the adjustment of females' investment in their brood seems to take various forms that appear to be related to different features of males' sexually selected traits, which raises the questions of how and why these different mechanisms have been selected.  2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","copulation;  egg;  female behavior;  life history trait;  male behavior;  maternal effect;  passerine;  reproductive cost;  vocalization, Aves;  Serinus canaria","00033472","English","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Andersson, M., Female choice selects for extreme tail length in a widowbird (1982) Nature, 299, pp. 818-820; Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey; Arnold, J.M., Hatch, J.J., Nisbet, I.C.T., Effects of egg size, parental quality and hatch-date on growth and survival of common tern Sterna hirundo chicks (2006) Ibis, 148, pp. 98-105; Ballentine, B., The ability to perform physically challenging songs predicts age and size in male swamps sparrows (Melospiza georgiana) (2009) Animal Behaviour, 77, pp. 973-978; Ballentine, B., Hyman, J., Nowicki, S., Vocal performance influences female response to male bird song: an experimental test (2004) Behavioral Ecology, 15, pp. 163-168; Balthazart, J., Activation of luteinizing hormone secretion by photoperiod and social stimuli: different paths to the same destination (2007) Endocrinology, 148, pp. 5611-5613; Blomqvist, D., Johansson, O.C., Gtmark, F., Parental quality and egg size affect chick survival in a precocial bird, the lapwing Vanellus vanellus (1997) Oecologia, 110, pp. 18-24; Bortolotti, G.R., Blas, J., Negro, J.J., Tella, J.L., A complex plumage pattern as an honest social signal (2006) Animal Behaviour, 72, pp. 423-430; Burley, N.T., Sexual selection for aesthetic traits in species with biparental care (1986) The American Naturalist, 127, pp. 415-445; Burley, N.T., The differential-allocation hypothesis: an experimental test (1988) The American Naturalist, 132, pp. 611-628; Christians, J.K., Avian egg size: variation within species and inflexibility within individuals (2002) Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, 77, pp. 1-26; Christy, J.K., Mimicry, mate choice, and the sensory trap hypothesis (1995) The American Naturalist, 146, pp. 171-181; Cunningham, E.J.A., Russell, A.F., Egg investment is influenced by male attractiveness in the mallard (2000) Nature, 404, pp. 74-77; Demidenko, E., (2004) Mixed Models: Theory and Applications, , J.

However, it is often difficult to distinguish between differential parental investment and compensation for a decrease in parental investment by an attractive mate. Using Barn Swallows Hirundo rustica gutturalis, in which males rarely participate in incubation, we investigated differential incubation investment of females. We made the following four observations: (1) Females participate in 94% of total nest attentiveness (time that eggs were incubated). (2) Female nest attentiveness was positively correlated with the ornamentation of their mates, the size of white spots in the tail, which is a measure of male attractiveness in this population. (3) Male nest attentiveness was not related to male ornaments. (4) Total nest attentiveness was positively correlated with the size of white spots in the tail. These results are consistent with differential parental investment, but not with compensation for a decrease in parental investment by a mate. Therefore, we conclude that female Barn Swallows that have acquired an attractive male invest differentially in incubation.

Although in principle the DAH holds for both sexes, male adjustment of parental investment has only been tested in a few experimental studies, revealing contradictory results. We conducted a field experiment to test whether male blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) allocate their parental effort in relation to female ornamentation (ultraviolet colouration of the crown), as predicted by the DAH.Results: We reduced the UV reflectance in a sample of females and compared parental care by their mates with that of males paired to sham-manipulated control females. As predicted by the DAH our results demonstrate that males paired with UV-reduced females invested less in feeding effort but did not defend the chicks less than males paired with control females.Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies providing support for male differential allocation in response to female ornamentation.  2012 Mahr et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Cyanistes caeruleus","17429994","English","Article","Scopus","14",NA,NA,NA,"Darwin, C.R., (1871) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, , John Murray, London; Andersson, M.B., (1994) Sexual selection, , Princeton University Press, Princeton; Amundsen, T., Why are female birds ornamented?

However, the large variations in breeding density observed in many species are yet to be fully explained. Here, we investigated the settlement patterns in a colonial species with variable breeding density and where resource distribution could be manipulated. The zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, is a classic avian model in evolutionary biology but we know surprisingly very little about nest site selection strategies and nesting densities in this species, and in fact, in nomadic species in general. Yet, important determinants of habitat selection strategies, including temporal predictability and breeding synchrony, are likely to be different in nomadic species than in the non-nomadic species studied to date. Here, we manipulated the distribution of nesting sites (by providing nest boxes) and food patches (feeders) to test four non-exclusive habitat selection hypotheses that could lead to nest aggregation: 1) attraction to resources, 2) attraction to breeding conspecifics, and 3) attraction to successful conspecifics and 4) use of private information (i.e. own reproductive success on a site). We found that wild zebra finches used conspecific presence and possibly reproductive success, to make decisions over where to locate their nests, but did not aggregate around water or food within the study areas. Moreover, there was a high degree of inter-individual variation in nesting density preference. We discuss the significance of our results for habitat selection strategy in nomadic species and with respect to the differential selection pressures that individuals breeding at different densities may experience.  2011 The Authors.

Yet, deviations from the expected pattern ""success-stay, failure-leave"" have been reported in several species. One possible explanation for these deviations would be that individuals do not use only their own breeding performance (i.e., private information) but also that of others (i.e., public information) to decide whether or not to divorce. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the relative importance of private and public information for mate choice decisions in female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata).We manipulated the reproductive performance of breeding pairs and measured females' preferences for their mate and the neighbouring male first following pair formation and then seven weeks later when all females had laid eggs and the young were independent. Although all females reduced their preference for their mate after a breeding failure, the decrease was significant only when the neighbouring pair had reproduced successfully. Furthermore, there was no evidence that females biased the sex ratio of their offspring according to their mate's attractiveness. On the other hand, after reproduction, both successful and unsuccessful females increased their preferences for males who had produced a larger proportion of sons. Despite the fact that other mechanisms may have also contributed to our findings, we suggest that females changed their mate preferences based on the proportion of sons produced by successful males, because offspring sex ratio reflects the male's testosterone level at the moment of fertilization and hence is an indicator of his immune condition.  2011 Drullion, Dubois.","testosterone, animal experiment;  article;  breeding success;  controlled study;  female;  finch;  male;  mate choice;  nonhuman;  physical attractiveness;  progeny;  sex ratio;  sexual behavior;  son;  Taeniopygia guttata;  animal;  physiology;  sexual behavior, Taeniopygia guttata, Animals;  Female;  Finches;  Male;  Sex Ratio;  Sexual Behavior, Animal","19326203","English","Article","Scopus","e29737",NA,NA,NA,"Andersson, M., Iwasa, Y., Sexual Selection (1996) Trends Ecol Evol, 11, pp. 53-58; Sullivan, M.S., Mate choice as an information gathering process under time constraint: implications for behaviour and signal design (1994) Anim Behav, 47, pp. 141-151; Coulson, J.C., The influence of the pair-bond and age on the breeding biology of the Kittiwake Gull Rissa tridactyla (1966) J Anim Ecol, 35, pp. 269-279; Ens, B.J., Safriel, U.N., Harris, M.P., Divorce in the long-lived and monogamous oystercatcher, Haematopus ostralegus: incompatibility or choosing the better option?

Michel 11, I-15121 Alessandria, Italy","In precocial bird species, the eggs represent a strong maternal allocation of resources and constitute most of the maternal investment since parents do not feed the young after they hatch. Females can differentially allocate resources in their eggs as a response to the environment experienced during the laying period, including the quality of their mate. To assess the importance of female selection on egg composition in the red-legged partridge, we tested breeding females in a choice trial in which they were allowed to choose between males. After the choice trials, the females were mated with their preferred male (P group), with a non-preferred one (NP group) or with a randomly selected male (RND group). Eggs laid by females of the three groups did not differ significantly in mass, shape, yolk, albumen or shell weight. Moreover, there was no significant difference in egg lysozyme concentration (an important albumen antimicrobial component). There was a significant difference in egg characteristics in relation to position in the laying order, with last-laid eggs being heavier and more spherical. Last-laid eggs contained more albumen but their shell was lighter and the albumen contained less lysozyme. This study shows that partner attractiveness may not influence the characteristics of egg quality, and that in this partridge species the females are able to invest in large clutches without a decrease of egg size but with a progressive decrease of egg quality.  2011 Dipartimento di Biologia Evoluzionistica dell'Universit, Firenze, Italia.","egg size;  gamebird;  hatching;  mate choice;  parental investment;  precociality;  preference behavior;  reproductive cost;  resource allocation;  weight, Alectoris rufa;  Aves","03949370","English","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,NA,NA,"We Thank, G., De Vito, A., Pico, A., Repetto, A., Vassallo for help in the field work, and E.

In addition to being the focus of some of the most high profile individual studies that have influenced maternal effects research in birds, the multitude of zebra finch studies together provide the most comprehensive set of data to illuminate general patterns and compare different maternally derived variables. Surprisingly, to date, virtually all of this work has focused on captive populations of the zebra finch that have been domesticated for many generations, and which are typically held under relatively constant environmental and dietary conditions. Here we report the first data on resource allocation across the egg laying sequence in a free-living wild population. Reassuringly we find that the patterns that have been found in the majority of studies of domesticated populations with respect to investment across the laying sequence were all present in the wild population. The size and mass of eggs increased through the laying sequence whilst the concentration of carotenoids significantly decreased across the laying sequence. Although there was no significant pattern with respect to testosterone across the laying sequence the first two eggs had a higher level of testosterone than the last few eggs in the clutch, which is also consistent with the findings of earlier studies in captive populations.  2011 The Authors.","captive population;  carotenoid;  clutch size;  data set;  domestication;  egg;  environmental conditions;  laying date;  maternal effect;  resource allocation;  songbird;  wild population, Aves;  Taeniopygia guttata","09088857","English","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Burley, N., The differential-allocation hypothesis: an experimental test (1988) Am.

However, it remains poorly understood how these skews are achieved. Female condition, and consequent variation in circulating hormones, provides a plausible mechanistic link between offspring sex biases and the environmental and social stresses commonly invoked to explain adaptive sex allocation, such as diet, territory quality, and body condition. However, although experimental studies have shown that female perception of male phenotype alone can lead to sex ratio biases, it is unknown how partner quality influences female physiological state. Using a controlled within-female experimental design where female Gouldian finches (Erythrura gouldiae) bred with both high-and low-quality males, we found that partner quality directly affects female hormonal status and subsequent fitness. When constrained to breeding with low-quality males, females had highly elevated stress responses (corticosterone levels) and produced adaptive male-biased sex ratios, whereas when they bred with high-quality males, females had low corticosterone levels and produced an equal offspring sex ratio. There was no effect of other maternal hormones (e.g., testosterone) or body condition on offspring sex ratios. Female physiological condition during egg production, and variation in circulating hormones in particular, may provide a general mechanistic route for strategic sex allocation in birds.  2011 The Author.","body condition;

In empirical studies, however, parents occasionally match rather than compensate for the actions of their partners. The recently proposed ""information model"" adds to the earlier theory by factoring in information on brood value and/or need into parental decision-making. This leads to a variety of predicted parental responses following a change in partner work-rate depending on the information available to parents. Methodology/Principal Findings: We experimentally test predictions of the information model using a population of long-tailed tits. We show that parental information on brood need varies systematically through the nestling period and use this variation to predict parental responses to an experimental increase in partner work-rate via playback of extra chick begging calls. When parental information is relatively high, partial compensation is predicted, whereas when parental information is low, a matching response is predicted. Conclusions/Significance: We find that although some responses are consistent with predictions, parents match a change in their partner's work-rate more often than expected and we discuss possible explanations for our findings.  2011 Meade et al.","Aegithalos caudatus;  animal behavior;  animal experiment;  article;  bird;  child parent relation;  controlled study;  feeding;  female;  male;  nestling;  nonhuman;  parental behavior;  prediction;  animal;  biological model;  feeding behavior;  interpersonal communication;  nesting;  physiology;  songbird;  statistical model, Aegithalidae, Animals;  Feeding Behavior;  Female;  Linear Models;  Male;  Models, Biological;  Negotiating;  Nesting Behavior;  Passeriformes","19326203","English","Article","Scopus","e19684",NA,NA,NA,"Trivers, R.L., Parental investment and sexual selection (1972) Sexual Selection and the Descent of Man, pp. 136-179. , In: Campbell B, editors, Chicago, Aldine Press; Clutton-Brock, T.H., The evolution of parental care (1991), Princeton, Princeton University Press; Maynard Smith, J., Parental investment: a prospective analysis (1977) Anim Behav, 25, pp. 1-9; Lessells, C.M., Sexual conflict (1999) Levels of selection in evolution (monographs in behaviour and ecology), pp. 75-99. , In: Keller L, editors, Levels of selection in evolution (monographs in behaviour and ecology) Princeton: Princeton University Press; Chase, I., Cooperative and noncooperative behavior in animals (1980) Am Nat, 115, pp. 27-857; Houston, A.I., Davies, N.B., The evolution of cooperation and life history in the dunnock Prunella modularis (1985) Behavioural Ecology: Ecological Consequences of Adaptive Behaviour, pp. 471-487. , In: Sibly RH, Smith RM, editors, Oxford, Blackwell Scientific Publication; McNamara, J., Gasson, C., Houston, A., Incorporating rules for responding into evolutionary games (1999) Nature, 401, pp. 368-371; McNamara, J.M., Houston, A.I., Barta, Z., Osorno, J.L., Should young ever be better off with one parent than with two?

Because sexually selected male traits should provide honest information about male genetic or phenotypic quality, females may invest more when paired with attractive males. However, there is substantial disagreement in the literature whether such differential allocation is a general pattern. Using a comparative meta-regression approach, we show that female birds generally invest more into reproduction when paired with attractive males, both in terms of egg size and number as well as food provisioning. However, whereas females of species with bi-parental care tend to primarily increase the number of eggs when paired with attractive males, females of species with female-only care produce larger, but not more, eggs. These patterns may reflect adaptive differences in female allocation strategies arising from variation in the signal content of sexually selected male traits between systems of parental care. In contrast to reproductive effort, female allocation of immune-stimulants, anti-oxidants and androgens to the egg yolk was not consistently increased when mated to attractive males, which probably reflects the context-dependent costs and benefits of those yolk compounds to females and offspring.  2011 The Royal Society.","adaptive radiation;  antioxidant;  bird;  female;  fitness;  life history theory;  male;  mate attraction;  maternal effect;  parent-offspring interaction;  parental care;  parental investment;  phenotypic plasticity;  physiological response;  regression analysis;  reproduction;  reproductive cost;  reproductive effort;  reproductive strategy;  resource allocation;  sexual selection","09628452","English","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Roff, D.A., (1992) The Evolution of Life Histories: Theory and Analysis, , 2nd edn.

In part this is because many different methods have been used by individual studies to quantify parental care (i.e. nest visit rate, time in the nest and number of feeds per visit), but these have not directly been compared. We used nestbox cameras to monitor parental visit rate and the distribution of food among the nestlings in domestic, captive wild and wild free-living zebra finches. The percentage of nest visits by parents in which they fed the nestlings was consistent, with multiple feeds to different nestlings occurring within a single visit. The quantity of food delivered and its distribution among the nestlings, however, varied greatly both within and between broods. The number of regurgitations a brood received correlated significantly with the number of individual feeds when accounting for environment, but not with nest visit rate or the duration of time parents spent in the nestbox. In captive conditions, parents visited the nest at twice the rate of wild free-living birds, overall providing nestlings with twice the amount of food. Captive conditions also led to food distribution becoming less equitable among the brood, owing to changes in the number of regurgitations per individual feed and the number of overall feeds per nest visit.  2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","captive population;  domestication;  food availability;  nest box;  nestling;  parental care;  passerine;  wild population, Aves;  Taeniopygia guttata","00033472","English","Article","Scopus",NA,"Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council","We thank Amanda Ridley, Eirik Svik and Nina Svedin for statistical advice and helpful comments on the manuscript, and thestaff at the UNSW Fowlers Gap Field station and Mylene Mariette for support during fieldwork.

Thus, when studying female parental investment, male investment must also be considered. We tested the hypothesis that the attractiveness of male house wrens (Troglodytes aedon) influences their investment independent of their own intrinsic quality by manipulating the number of nest sites (one = control; 4 = attractive) in each male's territory. Treatments (attractive or control) were applied prior to (natural state) or after (imposed state) male settlement, and male investment was determined twice during the nestling stage by the number of trips males made to the nest to provision their nestlings. Males that settled in the attractive territories were significantly older than those that settled in control territories in the natural state. There was a significant interaction effect between state and treatment on male provisioning. Provisioning rates of attractive and control males in the imposed state did not differ, but attractive males in the natural state provisioned at a lower rate than control males late in the nestling stage. Thus, provisioning by males is influenced more by their intrinsic quality than their attractiveness.  The Author 2010.

Extra-pair courtship is common in wild Zebra Finches, but rarely leads to mounting and as a result extra-pair paternity is infrequent, a result consistent with male Zebra Finch reproductive anatomy. Nonetheless, the species has proved to be an excellent model for sperm competition studies because its basic reproductive anatomy and reproductive processes are similar to other birds. The outcome of sperm competition in the Zebra Finch and other birds is best predicted by the passive sperm loss model, allowing for differences in sperm numbers and quality (fertilising capacity). Last male sperm precedence is not a 'rule' in birds but is a consequence of the way sperm competition experiments have been conducted. Several male reproductive traits, including sperm size and velocity in the Zebra Finch have a genetic basis, and, as the Zebra Finch genome project gains momentum, the genes for these traits will be identified.  2010 Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union.","adaptation;  anatomy;  captive population;  copulation;  courtship;  genome;  passerine;  paternity;  reproductive biology;  reproductive strategy;  research work;  sexual selection;  sperm competition;  velocity;  wild population, Australia, Aves;  Passeriformes;  Taeniopygia guttata","01584197","English","Review","Scopus",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ackay, E., Roughgarden, J., Extra-pair paternity in birds: Review of the genetic benefits (2007) Evolutionary Ecology Research, 9, pp. 855-868; Alcock, J., (2001) The Triumph of Sociobiology, , Oxford University Press: Oxford, MA, USA; Bakst, M.R., Wishart, G.J., Brillard, J.-P., Oviducal sperm selection, transport and storage in poultry (1994) Poultry Science Reviews, 5, pp. 117-143; Birkhead, T.R., Behavioural adaptations to high density breeding in the common guillemot Uria aalge (1978) Animal Behaviour, 26, pp. 321-331. , doi:10.1016/0003-3472(78)90050-7; Birkhead, T.R., Sperm-storage tubules in a passerine: The zebra finch Poephila guttata (Estrildidae) (1987) Journal of Zoology, 212, pp. 103-108. , doi:10.1111/j.1469-7998.1987.tb05117.x; Birkhead, T.R., (2000) Promiscuity: An Evolutionary History of Sperm Competition and Sexual Conflict, , Faber & Faber: London; Birkhead, T.R., (2008) The Wisdom of Birds - An Illustrated History of Ornithology, , Bloomsbury: London; Birkhead, T.R., Biggins, J.D., Sperm competition mechanisms in birds: Models and data (1998) Behavioral Ecology, 9, pp. 253-260. , doi:10.1093/ beheco/9.3.253; Birkhead, T.R., Fletcher, F., Sperm storage and release of sperm from the sperm storage tubules in Japanese Quail Coturnix japonica (1994) Ibis, 136, pp. 101-105. , doi:10.1111/j.1474-919X.1994.tb08137.x; Birkhead, T.R., Fletcher, F., Male phenotype and ejaculate quality in the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata (1995) Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 262 (1365), pp. 329-334. , DOI 10.1098/rspb.1995.0213; Birkhead, T.R., Fletcher, F., Sperm transport in the reproductive tract of female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) (1998) Journal of Reproduction and Fertility, 114, pp. 141-145. , doi:10.1530/jrf.0.1140141; Birkhead, T.R., Hunter, F.M., Numbers of sperm-storage tubules in the Zebra Finch (Poephila guttata) and Bengalese Finch (Lonchura striata) (1990) Auk, 107, pp. 193-197; Birkhead, T.R., Mller, A.P., (1992) Sperm Competition in Birds: Evolutionary Causes and Consequences, , Academic Press: London; Birkhead, T.R., Moller, A.P., Why do male birds stop copulating while their partners are still fertile?

There have undoubtedly been more studies on maternal effects in the Zebra Finch than any other single bird species. Studies of this species have examined the importance of maternal effects mediated through sex allocation, size, nutrients and hormones of of eggs, incubation behaviour and provisioning levels. A synthesis of all of this work illustrates some contrasting results (e.g. many high-profile results have failed to be replicated), some very common patterns (e.g. investment shifts through the laying sequence), and potentially interesting and complex interactions between traits (e.g. between sex of offspring and hormonal profiles of eggs). This extensive collection of work on the Zebra Finch provides useful general insight into the patterns of maternal investment in birds and the effects on offspring phenotype. However, we caution that the literature is probably littered with studies that have overemphasised the importance of some maternal effects and recent studies have highlighted analytical and logical flaws that have probably led to misplaced confidence in some of the findings reported to date. Finally, it is worth considering that the bulk of the literature is based on studies of captive domesticated birds and ecological and physiological data from individuals in the wild is currently lacking. The biological relevance of maternal effects documented in this model species is therefore unclear.  2010 Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union.","captive population;  egg size;  hormone;  incubation;  maternal effect;  parental care;  passerine;  phenotype;  sex allocation;  sexual selection, Aves;  Taeniopygia guttata","01584197","English","Review","Scopus",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alonso-Alvarez, C., Bertrand, S., Devevey, G., Prost, J., Faivre, B., Chastel, O., Sorci, G., An experimental manipulation of life-history trajectories and resistance to oxidative stress (2006) Evolution, 60, pp. 1913-1924; Alonso-Alvarez, C., Bertrand, S., Faivre, B., Sorci, G., Increased susceptibility to oxidative damage as a cost of accelerated somatic growth in zebra finches (2007) Functional Ecology, 21 (5), pp. 873-879. , DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2435.2007.01300.x; Alonso-Alvarez, C., Bertrand, S., Sorci, G., Sex-specific transgenerational effects of early developmental conditions in a passerine (2007) Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 91 (3), pp. 469-474. , DOI 10.1111/j.1095-8312.2007.00811.x; Arnold, K.E., Griffiths, R., Stevens, D.J., Orr, K.J., Adam, A., Houston, D.C., Subtle manipulation of egg sex ratio in birds (2003) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

Maternal testosterone in egg yolk influences the embryo's and chick's development. Females deposit testosterone in the eggs as a response to the environment experienced during the laying period, including the quality of their mate. To assess the relevance of the female's mate selection on egg characteristics in the grey partridge, Perdix perdix, we tested breeding females in a choice trial where they were allowed to choose between two males. After the choice trials, females were mated either with their preferred male (P group) or with the nonpreferred one (NP group). Although eggs laid by females of the two groups did not differ significantly in mass, females of the P group laid eggs with a higher yolk testosterone concentration than females of the NP group. This study agrees with previous work pointing out that partner attractiveness may play an important role in the transfer of maternally derived egg components.  2010.","breeding population;  egg;  gamebird;  mate choice;  parent-offspring interaction;  parental investment;  testosterone, Aves;  Perdix perdix","00033472","English","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,"We thank E.

The male attractiveness hypothesis may apply to extra-pair paternity (EPP) because socially monogamous females routinely mate with higher quality males outside the pair bond. We test these predictions using the Tibetan ground tit (Pseudopodoces humilis), a sexually monomorphic, socially monogamous, facultatively cooperative breeder. There was greater variation in actual reproductive success among males than females due to EPP. An excess of sons was detected for bi-parental (i. e., non-cooperative) broods wherein EPP was mainly sired by bi-parental males. The pattern was attributed to male-biased sex ratios produced for both EPP and within-pair offspring within the same broods. The reason for the latter case might be a random allocation of more offspring to sons by the potentially EPP-exposed females that have an inability to control fertilization by specific males. In cooperative broods where EPP mostly resulted from within-group helpers of presumed low-quality, as indicated by their failure in acquiring a social mate, there was a non-significant tendency for EPP offspring to be daughters and for within-pair offspring in the same broods to be unbiased. These results support the EPP-related male attractiveness hypothesis especially in terms of the overproduction of sons. Offspring produced through quasi-parasitism was unbiased towards either sex, suggesting a weak female choiceness with respect to the quality of host males.  2010 Springer-Verlag.","cooperative breeding;  evolutionary theory;  extra-pair copulation;  heritability;  host quality;  hypothesis testing;  life history trait;  male;  mate attraction;  pair bond;  parasitism;  passerine;  paternity;  reproductive cost;  reproductive success;  sex allocation;  sex ratio, Aves;  Passeriformes;  Pseudopodoces humilis","03405443","English","Article","Scopus",NA,"China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation,20080430986","Acknowledgments We thank Xuhui Ma, Chen Wang and Xianhai Zeng for their assistances in the field, and Drs.

Antimicrobial proteins (lysozyme, ovotransferrin, and avidin) are significant components of the avian albumen and likely aid in defense of embryos from microbial infection. Within clutches, females may enhance antimicrobial defense of early-laid eggs to protect them from the high risk of infection incurred before the onset of incubation. Among entire clutches, females may invest more resources in young sired by more attractive males because they have higher reproductive value. We tested these hypotheses by quantifying antimicrobial protein distribution within and among clutches in blue tit eggs. Contrary to our hypothesis, clutches showed no differential deposition of lysozyme or avidin within clutches, but eggs laid in the middle of the sequence had higher concentrations of ovotransferrin than eggs in the beginning and end. Consistent with our second hypothesis, we found that females produced eggs with higher concentrations of lysozyme (although not ovotransferrin or avidin) when mated to more attractive (more UV-reflective) males. Furthermore, females mated to polygynous males deposited less lysozyme than those mated to monogamous males. These data suggest that allocation of lysozyme at the clutch level may be a maternal effect mediated by male qualities.  2010 The Author(s).","clutch size;  enzyme activity;  fitness;  hypothesis testing;  incubation;  infectious disease;  maternal effect;  microbial activity;  passerine, Aves;  Cyanistes caeruleus","03405443","English","Article","Scopus",NA,"810.67.022","Acknowledgments We thank the Kraus-Groeneveld Foundation for permission to work at estate De Vosbergen.

However, there are surprisingly few empirical demonstrations that such association preferences predict the likelihood of females reproducing with a particular male. This information is essential to confirm association preferences as good predictors of mate choice. We used green swordtails (Xiphophorus helleri) to test whether association preferences predict the likelihood of a female reproducing with a male. Females were tested for a preference for long- or short-sworded males in a standard dichotomous choice experiment and then allowed free access to either their preferred or non-preferred male. If females subsequently failed to produce fry, they were provided a second unfamiliar male with similar sword length to the first male. Females were more likely to reproduce with preferred than non-preferred males, but for those that reproduced, neither the status (preferred/non-preferred) nor the sword length (long/short) of the male had an effect on brood size or relative investment in growth by the female. There was no overall preference based on sword length in this study, but male sword length did affect likelihood of reproduction, with females more likely to reproduce with long- than short-sworded males (independent of preference for such males in earlier choice tests). These results suggest that female association preferences are good indicators of female mate choice but that ornament characteristics of the male are also important.  2009 Springer-Verlag.","brood size;  cyprinid;  life history trait;  mate choice;  reproduction;  reproductive success;  sexual selection, Xiphophorus;  Xiphophorus hellerii","03405443","English","Article","Scopus",NA,"Natural Environment Research CouncilNatural Environment Research Council","Acknowledgements We would like to thank two anonymous referees for perceptive comments on the manuscript and J.

Empirical tests, however, have proved problematic because of the difficulties in isolating variables that yield clear and predictable fitness returns to individuals and because partner compensation in socially monogamous species is likely to confound individual investment strategies. We test the effect of parental investment by males and females in the color polymorphic Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae), a species with mutual mate choice and high fitness costs when breeding with incompatible partners. Using a within-individual experimental design, in which both males and females were forced to breed with mates of the same (matched) and different (mixed) color morph, we show that females, but not males, increased their provisioning effort when breeding with compatible mates. By crossfostering offspring within and between matched and mixed pairs, we also found that foster offspring reared by matched pairs, with increased female provisioning, were healthier, grew and developed faster, and fledged earlier than offspring reared by mixed pairs. Furthermore, due to the experimental design, these effects were directly mediated by differential investment by females and not by male compensation. Thus, our results provide support for maternal (but not paternal) effects in response to mate quality.","experimental design;  fitness;  mate choice;  parental care;  passerine;  reproductive cost, Erythrura gouldiae","10452249","English","Article","Scopus",NA,"Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council,DP0770889","Australian Research Council (Australian Postdoctoral Fellowship) Discovery Grant to S.R.P.

In this study we experimentally manipulated the perceived attractiveness of male starlings Sturnus unicolor by increasing the amount of green material in some nests (a male courtship display in this species). We predicted that, if female investment before laying is related to male attractiveness, experimental females would increase their reproductive investment in response to the addition of plants in their nests when compared to control females. We found that our manipulation caused variations in female reproductive investment in a way that seems to influence offspring quantity but not offspring quality: Females laid larger clutch sizes but not larger eggs when green plant material was added. However, yolk androgens contents were not related to the experimental manipulation. Contrary to expectations, females breeding in experimental nests laid eggs with smaller amounts of eggshell pigments. Interestingly, we found that eggs laid later in the sequence had higher testosterone levels and showed more intense egg colouration than eggs laid earlier in the sequence. These differences at the within-clutch level suggest that selection has favoured compensatory strategies for hatching asynchrony. Alternatively, since nest sabotages by other females are most common at the beginning of laying, this could be seen as female strategy to minimise losses due to nest sabotages.

We review evidence and functional explanations for the relationship between androgen concentrations in avian eggs and male attractiveness. Experimental studies in captive birds show generally positive relationships, but results from correlational and experimental field studies are less consistent, perhaps because they lack a within-female design to control for confounding between-female variation. We analyzed the effect of male attractiveness on yolk levels of maternal androgens in a wild bird, using a correlational and experimental approach with a within-female design. We manipulated the sexually selected UV coloration of the crown feathers of male blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) after their female had laid the second egg and measured the subsequent effect on androgen concentrations (testosterone and androstenedione) in the fifth, seventh, and ninth eggs relative to that in the second egg. Levels of testosterone, but not androstenedione, in eggs 5 and 7 were higher for control (attractive) than for UV-reduced (unattractive) males. This effect disappeared in the ninth egg, coinciding with the recovery of UV coloration after manipulation. This suggests that females are capable of rapid adjustments of testosterone deposition in response to changes in their mate's ornamental plumage. However, androgen concentrations in the second egg and pretreatment male crown coloration were not correlated. Possibly, the combination of relatively small variation in UV coloration before treatment and the influence of unknown confounding variables in the correlative approach resulted in insufficient statistical power to detect such a correlation.

Selection frequently favours plasticity in investment that can generate maternal effects on offspring development. For example, if females differentially allocate resources based on mate attractiveness or quality, this can create a non-genetic link between mate attractiveness and offspring fitness with potential consequences for ecological and evolutionary dynamics. It is therefore important to understand under what conditions differential investment into offspring in relation to male quality is expected to occur and the direction of the effect. Two opposite predictions, increased investment into offspring produced with high-quality mates (differential allocation (DA)) and increased investment with low-quality males (reproductive compensation (RC)) have been suggested but no formal theoretical treatment justifying the assumptions underlying these two hypotheses has been conducted to date. Here, we used a state-based approach to investigate the circumstances under which the variation in mate quality results in differential female investment into offspring and how this interacts with female energetic resource levels. We found that a pattern of increased investment when mating with high-quality mates (i.e. DA) was the most common optimal investment strategy for females in our model. By contrast, increased investment when mating with low-quality mates (i.e. RC) was predicted only when the relative impact of parental investment on offspring quality was low. Finally, we found that the specific pattern of investment in relation to male quality depends on female energetic state, the likelihood for future mating opportunities and the expected future distribution of mate quality. Thus, the female's age and body condition should be important factors mediating DA and RC, which may help to explain the equivocal results of empirical studies.  2009 The Royal Society.","body condition;  decision making;  fitness;  life history;  mate choice;  maternal effect;  parental investment;  phenotypic plasticity;  resource allocation;  sexual selection, animal;  article;  biological model;  breeding;  decision making;  female;  genetic selection;  male;  mate choice;  maternal behavior;  Monte Carlo method;  patient selection;  physiology;  probability;  psychological model;  reproduction;  sexual behavior, Animals;  Breeding;  Choice Behavior;  Female;  Male;  Maternal Behavior;  Mating Preference, Animal;  Models, Biological;  Models, Psychological;  Monte Carlo Method;  Patient Selection;  Probability;  Reproduction;  Selection (Genetics);  Sexual Behavior, Animal","09628436","English","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual selection, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Bluhm, C.K., Gowaty, P.A., Reproductive compensation for offspring viability deficits by female mallards, Anas platyrhynchos (2004) Anim.

The impact of artificial marking on experimental results is rarely explicitly considered despite evidence demonstrating that changes in phenotypic appearance can modify animal behavior and reproductive success. Here we present evidence that artificial marking of individuals within a social group has frequencydependent effects on the behavior and physiology of domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus). We demonstrate that when only 20 or 50% of individuals within a group were artificially marked, the marked birds received more aggression and had lesser body mass than the unmarked individuals within the same group. Furthermore, in groups in which only a small proportion of the individuals were marked, we report altered plasma epinephrine and dopamine levels in marked individuals. These effects of marking were imperceptible when all birds in a group were marked. This finding has important implications for animal research because, when only a subset of group members is artificially marked and used for data collection, the results obtained may not be representative of the population. 2008 Poultry Science Association Inc.","adrenalin;  corticosteroid;  dopamine;  noradrenalin, aggression;  animal;  animal behavior;  animal disease;  article;  blood;  body weight;  bone density;  chemistry;  chicken;  feces;  female;  male;  physiological stress;  physiology;  sexual behavior;  social behavior;  territoriality, Adrenal Cortex Hormones;  Aggression;  Animals;  Behavior, Animal;  Body Weight;  Bone Density;  Chickens;  Dopamine;  Epinephrine;  Feces;  Female;  Male;  Norepinephrine;  Sexual Behavior, Animal;  Social Behavior;  Stress, Physiological;  Territoriality, Animalia;  Aves;  Gallus gallus","00325791","English","Article","Scopus",NA,"Michigan Agriculture Experiment StationMichigan Agriculture Experiment Station","We thank L.

Small birds, for example, are often kept as pets and used in a wide variety of behavioural and physiological experiments where 'best' housing conditions are based on advice from experienced keepers as opposed to being tested experimentally. We investigated the effects of two husbandry conditions on the welfare of captive zebra finches: a) optional cover and b) rewarded handling versus random rewards. As a correlate of welfare in the four conditions (cover + reward, cover, reward, nothing), we recorded the time to settle and perform normal behaviours after an experimenter entered the room throughout the study (ie habituation to disturbance). In addition, we measured female preference for males in the four conditions to see whether welfare situation affected attractiveness as a mate. Birds in the two conditions where a reward was provided settled most quickly, and their settling time decreased across the study. Birds provided with cover alone become more disturbed by the entry of the experimenter as the study progressed. However, the birds taking longest on average to settle were those in cages with no cover and no reward. Females preferred males in the reward conditions as mates, either due to the fact that these males settled more quickly or because less-stressed males are more attractive in some other way. Thus, rewarding birds after disturbance is an effective and simple way to improve habituation to handling and human presence. In addition, these birds are more attractive to females, implying that males more habituated to captivity may be preferred as mates. Provision of cover may help under certain circumstances, but appears paradoxically to lead to increased fearfulness over time under the conditions studied here.  2008 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.","animal behavior;  animal experiment;  animal husbandry;  animal welfare;  article;  bird;  controlled study;  female;  finch;  habituation;  male;  mate choice;  nonhuman;  physical attractiveness;  reward;  statistical analysis;  stress, Animalia;  Aves;  Rodentia;  Taeniopygia guttata","09627286","English","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Buchwald, T., Wechsler, B., The effect of cover on the behaviour of Japanese quail (Cotumix japonica) (1997) Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 54, pp. 335-343; Burley, N., Coopersmith, C.B., Bill color preferences of zebra finches (1987) Ethology, 76, pp. 133-151; Burley, N.T., Parker, P.G., Lundy, K., Sexual selection and extrapair fertilization in a socially monogamous passerine, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttato) (1996) Behavioural Ecology, 7, pp. 218-226; Cabanac, A., Briese, E., Handling elevates the colonic temperature of mice (1992) Physiology & Behaviour, 51, pp. 95-98; Collins, S.A., Male displays - cause or effect of female preference (1994) Animal Behaviour, 48, pp. 371-375; Collins, S.A., ten Cate, C., Does beak colour affect female preference in zebra finches?

Carotenoids play crucial roles in antioxidant protection and immune defence mechanisms, but they may be available to females in limiting amounts. Therefore, their allocation to the eggs may be influenced by the female's condition, age and environmental circumstances. Furthermore, the quality of the male parent, which affects the reproductive value of the offspring, may also influence this investment. In this correlational study, we investigated proximate and ultimate factors that may lead to variation in yolk lutein, zeaxanthin and -carotene concentrations among and within clutches of a wild passerine, the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis). We found that carotenoid concentration was positively associated with caterpillar supply at the time of egg formation, which suggests a proximate constraint of carotenoid availability on yolk composition. Neither female condition, body size, age, nor male plumage ornamentation, age and body size correlated with carotenoid deposition. Yolk -carotene concentration was found to be positively linked to yolk testosterone concentration. We suggest that females allocated more -carotene to their eggs to mitigate the potentially detrimental effects of elevated steroid concentration. We found that concentration of -carotene increased with laying order. The possible function of this pattern may be to enhance the resistance to oxidative stress and pathogens of the disadvantaged last-hatching nestling, suggesting that collared flycatchers pursue a compensatory, ""brood survival"" strategy.  2006 Springer-Verlag.","carotenoid;  disease resistance;  egg development;  environmental factor;  fitness;  laying date;  maternal care;  nestling;  parental investment;  passerine;  reproductive cost;  stress resistance;  survival, Aves;  Ficedula albicollis;  Passeriformes","03405443","English","Article","Scopus",NA,"Hungarian Scientific Research FundHungarian Scientific Research Fund","Acknowledgements We are grateful to L.

One important direct benefit to females is the level of male parental assistance they receive when provisioning young. Three main hypotheses attempt to explain the relationship between male ornament size and parental care. The good parent hypothesis predicts that males with larger ornaments will provide more care, while the differential allocation and trade-off hypotheses predict that they will provide less care. We examined the relationship between male ornamentation and parental care in two populations of common yellowthroats, Geothlypis trichas, in which the sexually selected male ornament differs. More ornamented males provided less parental care in both populations, contrary to the good parent hypothesis. However, females did not feed their nestlings more frequently when mated with more ornamented males, which is an additional prediction of the differential allocation hypothesis. Our results are most consistent with the trade-off hypothesis, which suggests that more ornamented males provide less care because they spend relatively more of their effort in pursuing extrapair mates or defending their territories from other males.  2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","ornamentation;  paternal care;  plumage;  songbird, Geothlypis trichas","00033472","English","Article","Scopus",NA,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation,IBN-0416536","We thank J.

Lipid-soluble vitamins and carotenoids are potent antioxidants. Female birds deposit these antioxidants into eggs in variable amounts according to environmental and social conditions, and the quantities deposited into eggs can have effects on offspring health and immunological condition. Allocation theory posits that females will alter the distribution of resources according to mate quality, sometimes allocating resources according to the differential allocation hypothesis (DAH), investing more in offspring sired by better-quality males, and other times allocating resources according to a compensatory strategy, enhancing the quality of offspring sired by lower-quality males. It is unknown, however, whether antioxidants are deposited into eggs according to the DAH or a compensatory strategy. We examined deposition patterns of yolk antioxidants (including vitamin E and three carotenoids) in relation to laying order, mate attractiveness, female condition, and yolk androgen content in the house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus). Female house finches deposited significantly more total antioxidants into eggs sired by less attractive males. Additionally, yolk antioxidant content was significantly positively correlated with female condition, which suggests a cost associated with the deposition of antioxidants into eggs. Finally, concentrations of antioxidants in egg yolks were positively correlated with total yolk androgen content. We suggest that yolk antioxidants are deposited according to a compensatory deposition strategy, enabling females to improve the quality of young produced with less attractive males. Additionally, yolk antioxidants may act to counter some of the detrimental effects associated with high levels of yolk androgens in eggs and, thus, may exert a complementary effect to yolk androgens.  2006 by The University of Chicago.

It has been proposed that female birds and reptiles deposit yolk androgens according to the differential allocation hypothesis (DAH), which posits the allocation of more resources to offspring sired by more attractive, higher-quality males. We examined deposition patterns of yolk androgens in relation to mate attractiveness in the house finch Carpodacus mexicanus. Contrary to the predictions of the DAH, female house finches deposited significantly more androgens into eggs sired by less attractive males. We propose that, rather than serving as resources, androgens are used as mediators in a compensatory distribution strategy, enabling females to improve the quality of young produced with less attractive males.

Luisa s/n, Sevilla, E-41013, Spain","Aims: Female birds deposit variable amounts of androgens in their eggs, and research shows that these hormones can influence several aspects of offspring development and phenotype. Some evidence suggests that yolk androgen deposition may be a costly investment for the female bird. We studied the relationship between female expression of a male ornament and yolk androgen deposition in the pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca. In this species, some females present a white forehead patch, which is an ornament typically restricted to males. Female expression of this trait has previously been found to be associated with older age and low levels of blood parasites. We predicted that, if yolk androgen deposition is costly, eggs from females displaying a white forehead patch should contain higher concentrations of yolk androgens that those laid by females lacking that ornament. Location: La Hiruela, central Spain. Methods:We measured testosterone (T) and androstenedione (A4) levels in 10 pied flycatcher broods, after an ether extraction, following a radioimmunoassay method. Results and Conclusions:We found that yolk T and A4concentrations increased with laying order. However, the increase in A4 with laying order was steeper for females without a forehead patch than for those expressing it. Also, and contrary to expectations, we found a marginally significant trend for females with white foreheads to have lower yolk-T levels. We discuss these results with reference to the adaptive function of hatching asynchrony.",NA,"05707358","English","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Amundsen, T., Why are female birds ornamented?

We tested predictions of the differential allocation hypothesis, by experimentally increasing and decreasing male blue tit, Parus caeruleus, sexual attractiveness and recording subsequent measures of male and female parental effort during the chick-feeding period. We used marker pens, to create two distinct male phenotypes: one more attractive phenotype with a shift in peak reflectance towards the ultraviolet (UV) part of the spectrum (UV+) and one less attractive phenotype with a shift towards the human-visible part of the spectrum (UV-). There was no significant difference in absolute or relative female feeding rate with respect to treatment. However, there were significant interaction effects between treatment and female age on female feeding rate, indicating that 1-year-old females provisioned more when mated to a UV+ male than a UV- male. UV- males fed their chicks at a higher rate than UV+ males, but there was no significant difference between the groups in total feeding rate. Females contributed less to nest defence relative to their mates when they were mated to UV- males, whereas the opposite was true for females mated to UV+ males. The behavioural responses did not translate into differences in measures of reproductive output. Our study suggests that male phenotypic appearance at the chick-feeding stage influences female decisions about level of parental effort.  2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Females mated with high-quality males are therefore expected to have higher investment than females mated with low-quality males, which could bias estimates of paternal effects. Investigating the traits females use in their allocation decisions and the aspects of reproduction that are altered is essential for understanding how sexual selection is affected. We studied the potential for differential female allocation in a captive population of a precocial bird, the Chinese quail, Coturnix chinensis. Females paired with males with large sexual ornaments laid larger, but not more, eggs than females paired with males with small sexual ornaments. Furthermore, female egg mass was also significantly positively affected by male testis size, probably via some unknown effect of testis size on male phenotype. Testis size and ornament size were not correlated. Thus, both primary and secondary male sexual traits could be important components of female allocation decisions. Experimental manipulation of hormone levels during embryonic development showed that both male and female traits influencing female egg size were sensitive to early hormone exposure. Differences in prenatal hormone exposure as a result of maternal steroid allocation to eggs may explain some of the variation in reproductive success among individuals, with important implications for non-genetic transgenerational effects in sexual selection.

In oviparous animals this can include prefertilization decisions such as the production of larger eggs and the deposition of hormones, such as the steroid testosterone, into yolks. On the other hand, a compensatory hypothesis posits that females allocate more resources into the eggs when mated with males of inferior quality. In the present study, we show that free-living females of the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis), a small passerine bird, do not produce larger eggs or deposit more testosterone into eggs when mating with attractive males reflected by a large forehead patch size, which is contrary to the prediction of the differential allocation hypothesis. However, we found higher yolk testosterone concentrations in eggs laid for young than older males. Because in young males genetic quality, parental experience, or willingness to invest into paternal care is likely to be low, high yolk testosterone level in their clutches may indicate that their females follow a compensatory tactic. They may elicit more paternal care from young, inexperienced males by hormonally increasing nestling begging. Laying date was also correlated with yolk testosterone level; however, when we controlled for it, male age still remained a strong determinant of testosterone allocation.

Unit, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium","Avian eggs contain substantial amounts of maternal hormones and so provide an excellent model to study hormone-mediated maternal effects. We review this new and rapidly evolving field, taking an ecological and evolutionary approach and focusing on effects and function of maternal androgens in offspring development. Manipulation of yolk levels of androgens within the physiological range indicates that maternal androgens affect behaviour, growth, morphology, immune function and survival of the offspring, in some cases even long after fledging. Descriptive and experimental studies show systematic variation in maternal androgen deposition both within and among clutches, as well as in relation to the sex of the embryo. We discuss the potential adaptive value of maternal androgen transfer at all these three levels. We conclude that maternal androgen deposition in avian eggs provides a flexible mechanism of non-genetic inheritance, by which the mother can favour some offspring over others, and adjust their developmental trajectories to prevailing environmental conditions, producing different phenotypes. However, the literature is less consistent than often assumed and at all three levels, the functional explanations need further experimental testing. The field would greatly benefit from an analysis of the underlying physiological mechanisms.  2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Sci., University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; School of Botany and Zoology, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia","The fitness consequences of mate choice are a source of ongoing debate in evolutionary biology. Recent theory predicts that indirect benefits of female choice due to offspring inheriting superior genes are likely to be negated when there are direct costs associated with choice, including any costs of mating with attractive males. To estimate the fitness consequences of mating with males of varying attractiveness, we housed female house crickets, Acheta domesticus, with either attractive or unattractive males and measured a variety of direct and indirect fitness components. These fitness components were combined to give relative estimates of the number of grandchildren produced and the intrinsic rate of increase (relative net fitness). We found that females mated to attractive males incur a substantial survival cost. However, these costs are cancelled out and may be outweighed by the benefits of having offspring with elevated fitness. This benefit is due predominantly, but not exclusively, to the effect of an increase in sons' attractiveness. Our results suggest that the direct costs that females experience when mating with attractive males can be outweighed by indirect benefits. They also reveal the value of estimating the net fitness consequences of a mating strategy by including measures of offspring quality in estimates of fitness.

We experimentally altered the attractiveness of males by treating them with implants filled with crystalline testosterone (T) or left empty (C). We subsequently monitored maternal investment as a function of male hormonal treatment and the size of the black patch of feathers on the throat (i.e., the badge), a sexually selected trait. The differential allocation hypothesis predicts that females should adjust their investment with respect to the benefits they receive by mating with an attractive male. Given that both circulating levels of T and badge size are condition-dependent traits, we expected that females mated with T males and/or with large-badged males should invest more into current reproduction. Contrary to this prediction, we found no evidence that suggested differential maternal allocation in this population of house sparrows. Female investment in yolk T, yolk mass, clutch size, chick brooding, and feeding was not affected by male hormonal treatment or by male badge size. As expected, T males invested less into chick brooding and feeding. More surprisingly, females did not compensate the reduced paternal contribution to chick feeding. As a consequence, the breeding success of T pairs was largely reduced compared with that of C pairs. The absence of differential allocation in a system in which it could have an adaptive role raises the question about the possible constraints or overriding factors operating on patterns of reproductive investment in this species.","maternal care;  parental care;  parental investment;  reproductive behavior;  sexual selection, Gallus gallus;  Passer;  Passer domesticus;  Passeridae;  Vertebrata","10452249","English","Article","Scopus",NA,"03428","We would like to thank Camille Bonneaud for comments on a previous version of the manuscript, Cline Clment-Chastel for assistance in the field, Claudy Haussy for assistance with the preparation of implants, and the Centre dEtudes Biologiques de Chiz for logistical support.

Incubation behaviour is a costly part of avian parental care, and therefore likely to depend on the parent's body condition. We manipulated the body condition of zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, during incubation by using prelaying diets of different protein content, and induced birds to lay a similar number of eggs. We tested the hypothesis that birds in better body condition would invest more in incubation than birds in poorer condition when incubating on the same diet. Females that had received a high-protein prelaying diet lost more body mass than those that had received a low-protein diet. They also increased the length of their incubation bouts between early and middle incubation, whereas females that had received a low-protein prelaying diet increased bout length only between middle and late incubation. There were no differences between males from the two diet groups, and males were responsible for a lesser proportion of incubation than females. These results indicate that incubation behaviour is state dependent in female zebra finches, and that birds of different body condition adopt different incubation strategies. We found no differences in incubation duration and hatching success between the two incubation strategies in captivity, but the potential risk of nest predation in the wild may differ. We suggest that only females in good condition can afford to adopt a strategy of increasing bout length early in incubation; females in poorer condition first have to recover their body condition after having produced a clutch.  2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","bird;  body condition;  diet;  incubation;  parental care;  resource allocation, Aves;  Fringillidae;  Galliformes;  Taeniopygia;  Taeniopygia guttata;  Taeniopygia guttata","00033472","English","Article","Scopus",NA,"Natural Environment Research CouncilNatural Environment Research Council","We thank Dorothy Armstrong and Aileen Stevenson who cared for the zebra finches, Tom Sawyer and Nosrat Mirzai who helped with the camera set-up, and Pat Monaghan, Kate Arnold and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments.

Females mating with high quality males should, therefore, be expected to produce brood sex ratios biased towards sons, as male offspring would receive a relatively greater advantage from inheritance of their father's characteristics than would their female siblings. Furthermore, it has been suggested that sex allocation in chicks fathered through extrapair fertilizations should also be biased towards sons. Contrary to these predictions, we found no evidence that the distribution of sex ratios in a sample of 1483 chicks from 154 broods of blue tits (Parus caeruleus) deviated significantly from that of a binomial distribution around an even sex ratio. In addition, we found no significant effect on brood sex ratio of the individual quality of either parent as indicated by their biometrics, feather mite loads, time of breeding, or parental survival. This suggests that females in our population were either unable to manipulate offspring sex allocation or did not do so because selection pressures were not strong enough to produce a significant shift away from random sex allocation. The paternity of 986 chicks from 103 broods was determined using DNA microsatellite typing. Extrapair males sired 115 chicks (11.7%) from 41 broods (39.8%). There was no significant effect of paternity (within-pair versus extrapair) on the sex of individual offspring. We suggest that, in addition to the weakness of selection pressures, the possible mechanisms responsible for the allocation of sex may not be sufficiently accurate to control offspring sex at the level of the individual egg.","body condition;  extra-pair copulation;  passerine;  paternity;  sex allocation;  sex ratio, Acari;  Parus caeruleus;  Passeriformes","10452249","English","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Andersson, S., Ornborg, J., Andersson, M., Ultraviolet sexual dimorphism and assortative mating in blue tits (1998) Proc R Soc Lond B, 265, pp. 445-450; Ankney, C.D., Sex ratio varies with egg sequence in Lesser Snow Geese (1982) Auk, 99, pp. 662-666; Baltz, A.P., Clark, A.B., Extra-pair courtship behaviour of male budgerigars and the effect of an audience (1997) Anim Behav, 53, pp. 1017-1024; Bassam, B.J., Caetanoanolles, G., Greshoff, P.M., Fast and sensitive silver staining of DNA in polyacrylamide gels (1991) Anal Biochem, 196, pp. 80-83; Behnke, J., McGregor, P., Cameron, J., Hartley, I., Shepherd, M., Gilbert, F., Barnard, C., Wiles, R., Semi-quantitative assessment of wing feather mite (Acarina) infestations on passerine birds from Portugal - Evaluation of the criteria for accurate quantification of mite burdens (1999) J Zool, 248, pp. 337-347; Bensch, S., Price, T., Kohn, J., Isolation and characterization of microsatellite loci in a Phylloscopus warbler (1997) Mol Ecol, 6, pp. 91-92; Birkhead, T.R., Mller, A.P., (1992) Sperm competition in birds: evolutionary causes and consequences, , London: Academic Press; Birkhead, T., Schwabl, H., Burke, T., Testosterone and maternal effects - Integrating mechanisms and function (2000) Trends Ecol Evol, 15, pp. 86-87; Bradbury, R.B., Cotton, P.A., Wright, J., Griffiths, R., Nestling sex ratio in the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) (1997) J Avian Biol, 28, pp. 255-258; Burley, N., Sex-ratio manipulation in color-banded populations of zebra finches (1986) Evolution, 40, pp. 1191-1206; Burley, N.T., Calkins, J.D., Sex ratios and sexual selection in socially monogamous zebra finches (1999) Behav Ecol, 10, pp. 626-635; Charnov, E.L., (1982) The theory of sex allocation, , Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press; Cohen, J., (1976) Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences, , London: Academic Press; Colegrave, N., Birkhead, T.R., Lessells, C.M., Sperm precedence in zebra finches does not require special mechanisms of sperm competition (1995) Proc R Soc Lond B, 259, pp. 223-228; Cooke, F., Harmsen, R., Does sex ratio vary with egg sequence in Lesser Snow Geese?

When variance in reproductive success is higher in males than females, and some males are more attractive to females than others, thereby achieving higher reproductive success, female parents mated to attractive males are expected to bias reproductive allocation toward sons. Modification of the primary sex ratio is one mechanism by which avian parents may bias allocation. In mate choice trials, captive female dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) prefer to associate with males whose circulating testosterone level has been elevated experimentally. We asked whether females socially mated to testosterone-treated males in nature might bias the sex ratio of progeny in favor of sons. We determined the primary sex ratio of broods using a sex-linked molecular marker, the CHD gene on the W chromosome. We found no relationship between the hormonal treatment of males and the primary or secondary sex ratios of offspring produced by their social mates. Sex ratio was also unrelated to breeding-season date, study year, male viability, or female age. While unlikely, it is possible that female juncos are not able to manipulate the primary sex ratio of their broods. More likely, possible benefits to female juncos of producing attractive sons may be small because (1) attractive males do not necessarily have higher fitness, depending on the trade-offs involved for males, and (2) when such benefits exist, they may be outweighed for females by the costs of compensating for the reduced paternal care of attractive males.","fitness;  mate choice;  sex allocation;  sex ratio","03405443","English","Article","Scopus",NA,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation,IBN-9728384","Acknowledgements We are deeply grateful to Kate Lessells for statistical consultation and for performing randomization tests, Eric Snajdr for expert field assistance and data management, Loren Rieseberg for use of laboratory facilities, and the University of Virginias Mountain Lake Biological Station and the Mountain Lake Conservancy for access to their property.

Attention is currently focused on whether females choose males on the basis of their genetic quality, in order to produce more viable offspring. Support for this hypothesis in birds has come from studies showing that preferred males tend to father offspring of better condition or with increased survivor, ship. Before attributing greater offspring viability to a male's heritable genetic quality, however, it is important to discount effects arising from confounding sources, including maternal effects. This has generally been addressed by comparing offspring viability from two different breeding attempts by the same female: one when offspring are sired by a preferred male, and one when offspring are sired by a less preferred male. However, here we show that individual female mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) lay larger eggs after copulating with preferred males and smaller eggs after copulating with less preferred males. As a result, females produced offspring of better body condition when paired with preferred males. After controlling for these differences in maternal investment, we found no effect of paternity on offspring condition. This shows that differences between halfsibs cannot always be attributed to paternal or maternal genetic effects.","reproductive behavior;  sexual behavior, animal experiment;  article;  breeding;  duck;  egg;  nonhuman;  parental behavior;  priority journal;  progeny;  reproduction, Animals;  Beauty;  Ducks;  Female;  Male;  Ovum;  Sexual Behavior, Animal;  Social Dominance, Anas platyrhynchos;  Anas sp.;  Animalia;  Aves;  Platyrhynchos","00280836","English","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Andersson, M., (1994) Sexual Selection, , Princeton Univ.

The possibility that sex ratio influences the success of social mating patterns (leading to polygyny when males are rare and polyandry when females are rare) was not supported. Results did support the prediction of the differential allocation hypothesis that individuals of the abundant sex would increase their relative parental expenditure (PE). Although total (male + female) PE did not vary between treatments, relative male PE was significantly higher in the male-biased treatment (MBT; sex ratio 64% male) than in the female-biased treatment (FBT; sex ratio 36% male). In both treatments, male PE contributions contributed to female reproductive rate. Results also supported the prediction of the differential access hypothesis that individuals of the abundant sex would experience greater intensity of selection on sexually selected attributes. Male beak color, a sexually selected trait, influenced male social parentage in the MBT but not in the FBT. Finally, broods in the FBT displayed higher hatching asynchrony and lower hatching success; we believe this was caused by early onset of incubation, a tactic used as a defense against intraspecific brood parasitism, which was much higher in the FBT. Population sex ratios may be an important factor affecting female ability to influence male parental investment patterns.","parental care;  parental investment;  reproductive strategy;  sex ratio;  sexual selection, Taeniopygyia guttata","10452249","English","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Altmann, J., Observational study of behaviour; sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-267; Arnold, S.J., Duvall, D., Animal mating systems: A synthesis based on selection theory (1994) Am Nat, 143, pp. 317-348; Balzer, A.L., Williams, T.D., Do female zebra finches vary primary reproductive effort in relation to mate attractiveness?

We used the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata as a study species, since the traits that females find attractive in males of this species, song rate and beak colour, are well established. A paired experimental design comprising 31 pairs of brothers was used; for each pair, one male was assigned to a control group provided with ad libitum food and no additional exercise, and the other male was assigned to an experimental group which experienced additional exercise and a reduced rate of food intake. After 11 weeks, the experimental group differed significantly from the control group in a range of variables, including body mass, haematocrit, granulocyte:lymphocyte (G:L) ratio and several primary sex traits, indicating that condition in this group was reduced. Birds in the experimental group showed a differential response to the treatment. We used the rank order in which birds could be captured by an experimenter as an index of condition. Birds easily caught were assumed to be in poorer condition than those which were more difficult to capture. Rank capture order was repeatable and was significantly correlated with the G:L ratio in the experimental group, but not in the control group. In the experimental group, rank capture order was correlated significantly with both secondary sex traits: birds in better condition had redder beaks and a higher song rate. However, beak colour and song rate did not covary significantly, suggesting that these two traits provide different types of information. Secondary sex traits did not covary with primary sex traits or any sperm features. Thus, there was no evidence for Trivers' sexual-competence hypothesis or the phenotype-linked fertility hypothesis. We used four assays of immune capacity, two general (G:L ratio and spleen mass) and two specific [antibody titres to sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) and Brucella abortus (BA)]. The G:L ratio was significantly higher in the experimental group, spleen mass (absolute and relative) did not differ between the groups, anti-SRBC antibody titres were significantly higher in the control group (contrary to expectation), and anti-BA antibody titres were close to being significantly lower in the experimental group. Within the experimental group, there was no evidence that antibody titres covaried with secondary sex traits. Although we demonstrated that beak colour and song rate were condition dependent, our experiment provided no evidence that either of these traits covaried with immune capacity or sperm features.","body condition;  immunocompetence;  passerine;  secondary sexual characteristics;  sexual selection","03405443","English","Article","Scopus",NA,"National Eye Research CentreNational Eye Research Centre","Acknowledgements We thank T.F.

Here we show that female zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, vary their 'primary' reproductive effort in egg production in relation to the attractiveness of their male partner, for some components of reproduction but not others. Females were allowed to choose 'preferred' and 'non-preferred' males in standard mate choice trials, and were then paired sequentially with each male. Preferred males had significantly higher song duration and song frequency than non-preferred males confirming that females preferred attractive, higher quality males. Male attractiveness had a positive, but weak, effect on clutch size: in breeding experiments individual females laid on average 0.5 eggs more when paired with their preferred male compared to the non-preferred male. However, there was no significant difference in breeding propensity (whether females laid eggs or not), number of days between pairing and laying, mean egg size or egg quality (protein and lipid composition) in relation to male type. These results suggest that components of primary reproductive effort in individual female zebra finches are relatively non-plastic traits.",NA,"00057959","English","Article","Scopus",NA,"Simon Fraser UniversitySimon Fraser University","1) Corresponding author; e-mail: tdwillia@sfu.ca 2) We thank Shawn Ternan for help with care of birds and building the 'Finkatron'.

Box 35, FIN-40351 Jyvskyl, Finland","Variation in female behaviour has only recently received attention in studies of sexual selection. It has been suggested that females may invest differentially in their offspring in relation to the quality of their mate. This may lead to females that mate with high-quality and/or attractive males laying larger clutches. Females may also differ in their ability to choose between males. For example, females in good physical condition may make better choices. If physical condition and clutch size are positively correlated, this hypothesis could also produce a relationship between male attractiveness and female clutch size. We found, in lekking black grouse, Tetrao tetrix, that females mated to the highest ranked males laid the largest clutches. Furthermore we found, regardless of female age, a positive relationship between a measure of female condition and male rank but not between female condition and her clutch size. In addition, females in good condition visited a larger number of different male territories, and old females produced the largest clutches. Our results suggest two mechanisms to explain our findings. First, females in good physical condition tend to mate with the top males, suggesting an assortative mating pattern. Second, females mating with the highest ranked males lay larger clutches as a consequence of their choice. In general, our result calls for caution in evaluating studies that look at the consequences of mate choice. It may be that differences in female quality produce effects that may be wrongly interpreted as male quality effects.","female behavior;  mate choice;  sexual selection, Tetrao tetrix","00033472","English","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ahnesj, I., Vincent, A., Alatalo, R., Halliday, T., Sutherland, W.J., The role of females in influencing mating patterns (1993) Behavioral Ecology, 4, pp. 187-189; Alatalo, R.V., Lundberg, A., Glynn, C., Female pied flycatchers choose territory quality and not male characteristics (1986) Nature, 323, pp. 152-153; Alatalo, R.V., Hglund, J., Lundberg, A., Patterns of variation in tail ornament size in birds (1988) Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 34, pp. 363-374; Alatalo, R.V., Hglund, J., Lundberg, A., Sutherland, W.J., Evolution of black grouse leks: Female preferences benefit males in larger leks (1992) Behavioral Ecology, 3, pp. 53-59; Alatalo, R.V., Burke, T., Dunn, J., Hanotte, O., Hglund, J., Lundberg, A., Moss, R., Rintamki, P.T., Paternity, copulation disturbance and female choice in lekking black grouse (1996) Animal Behaviour, 52, pp. 861-873; Apollonio, M., Festa-Bianchet, M., Mari, F., Correlates of copulatory success in a fallow deer lek (1989) Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 25, pp. 89-97; Bradbury, J.W., Vehrencamp, S.L., Gibson, R., Leks and the unanimity of female choice (1985) Evolution: Essays in Honour of John Maynard Smith, pp. 301-314. , Ed. by P.

We tested whether testosterone may also affect male reproductive behaviour by mediating the intensity and frequency of male courtship. In two simultaneous choice experiments, we assessed the relative attractiveness of testosterone-implanted males, whose testosterone levels were manipulated to match naturally occurring spring peaks, and empty-implanted control males, whose testosterone levels were lower and resembled those of males caring for young. In both experiments, testosterone-males outperformed control-males, giving both more frequent and more exaggerated displays. Females showed a significant preference for the peak-testosterone males as measured by both female attendance and female courtship displays. We concluded that variation in testosterone can affect male attractiveness to females and thus male copulatory success. Thus, testosterone has the potential to mediate all aspects of male reproductive behaviour and may provide a mechanism through which males adjust their full range of breeding behaviours (i.e. inter-sexual as well as intra-sexual and parental behaviour) to fit their current status. In a second experiment, we tested the effect of oestradiol treatment on female mating preferences. No evidence was found that oestradiol changed the preferences of females.","courtship;  dark-eyed junco;  mate choice;  reproductive behaviour;  testosterone, Junco hyemalis;  Junco hyemalis","00033472","English","Article","Scopus",NA,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation,IBN-9408061","We thank H.

This phenomenon is termed cryptic female choice in insects and differential allocation in birds. In this study I investigate the possibility that males and females vary their reproductive effort depending on the quality of their mate. Females of the comma butterfly, Polygonia c- album (Nymphalidae) lay their eggs on a range of host plants, including stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) and sallow (Salix caprea). Previous studies have shown that females reared on sallow are more fecund than females reared on stinging nettle, whereas males reared on stinging nettle produce spermatophores with higher protein content than sallow-reared males. Radioactive label experiments showed that females use male donations for egg production. When females mated males that provided larger donations, they used proportionally more of these proteins for egg production but also increased their own reproductive effort. Female lifetime reproductive output was not found to differ with respect to the larval diet of their mate, but females mated to high-quality males lived significantly longer than females mated to males providing them with smaller donations, which suggests that females can use male nutrients also for somatic maintenance. These results are discussed in relation to female cryptic choice and differential allocation hypotheses.","comma butterfly;  cryptic female choice;  mate quality;  reproductive effort;  stinging nettle, Lepidoptera;

In addition, males of self-selected pairs performed courtship singing at higher rate than those of random pairs. However, in the following brood most differences disappeared as the number of eggs laid and young fledged increased in the random group and the rate of courtship singing decreased in the self-selected group. It appears, therefore, that choosy females do enjoy a reproductive advantage even though they do not necessarily choose genetically superior males. Male budgerigars singing too little might be simply unable to stimulate ovarian development and sexual response of the female.  1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",NA,"11250003","English","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Alatalo, R.V., Carlsson, A., Lundberg, A., The search cost in mate choice of the pied flycatcher (1988) Anim.

In males, PE was estimated as the hunting effort (the proportion of budget time spent in flight-hunting) and in females as the food provisioning rate (number of prey items delivered to the nest per hour). The following predictions derived from the parental investment theory were examined. (1) Parents rearing large clutches and broods should invest more in breeding than do parents rearing small clutches and broods. The hunting effort of parents did not increase with clutch or brood size, but males tending large broods had a higher prey delivery rate than males tending small broods (Figs 1-2). (2) PE of parents should increase in the course of the breeding season. In males, this was true only between the incubation and early nestling phases (Fig. 3). (3) The early pairs should invest more in breeding than late ones. This tended to be true during the early (for males) and late nestling phases (for females) (Fig. 4). (4) There should be a negative correlation between PE of mates within pairs, but no evidence for such adjustment was found (Fig. 5). (5) Females mated with bright-coloured attractive males should show higher PE than females mated with dull-coloured males but our results were inconsistent with this prediction. We conclude that PE decisions of kestrels are mainly based on cost-benefit estimates of residual reproductive value, rather than on current investment indicators, like clutch or brood size. This might be beneficial in environments with highly variable survival prospects of offspring caused by pronounced among-year variation in abundance of the main food (microtine rodents). The results also show that hypotheses explaining variation in PE in the short term are not necessarily valid for long-term PE, e.g. tending clutches or broods, which also reflects the demands of female and young.  1994 Springer-Verlag.","brood size;  clutch size;  kestrel;  parental effort, Finland, Falco tinnunculus;  Microtinae","03405443","English","Article","Scopus",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior: sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-267; Andersson, M., Wiklund, C.G., Rundgren, H., Parental defence of offspring: a model and an example (1980) Anim Behav, 28, pp. 536-542; Barash, D.P., Evolutionary aspects of parental behaviour: distraction behaviour of the alpine accentor (1975) Wilson Bull, 87, pp. 367-373; Biebach, H., Energetic costs of incubation on different clutch sizes in starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) (1981) Ardea, 69, pp. 141-142; Biermann, G.C., Sealy, S.G., Parental feeding of nestling yellow warblers in relation to brood size and prey availability (1982) Auk, 99, pp. 332-341; Burley, N., The differential-allocation hypothesis: an experimental test (1988) Am Nat, 132, pp. 611-628; Cav, A.J., The breeding of the kestrel, Falco tinnunculus L. in the reclaimed area Oostelijk Flevoland (1968) Neth J Zool, 18, pp. 313-407; Chase, I.D., Cooperative and co-operative behaviour in animals (1980) The American Naturalist, 115, pp. 827-857; Clutton-Brock, T.H., (1991) The evolution of parental care, , Princeton University Press, Princeton; Coleman, R.M., Whittall, R.D., Clutch size and the cost of incubation in the Bengalese finch (Lonchura striata var. domestica) (1988) Behav Ecol Sociobiol, 23, pp. 367-372; Curio, E., Regelmann, K., Zimmerman, U., The defence of first and second broods by great tit (Parus major) parents: a test of predictive sociobiology (1984) Z Tierpsychol, 66, pp. 100-127; Dawkins, R., Carlisle, R.T., Parental investment, mate desertion and a fallacy (1976) Nature, 262, pp. 131-133; Dijkstra, C., Vuursteen, L., Daan, S., Masman, D., Clutch size and laying date in the kestrel Falco tinnunculus: effects of supplementary food (1982) Ibis, 124, pp. 210-213; Fisher, R.A., (1930) The genetical theory of natural selection, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Hakkarainen H, Korpimki E (1994) Nest defence of Tengmalm's owl reflects offspring survival prospects under fluctuating food conditions.
