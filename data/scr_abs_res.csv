However, previous tests of this hypothesis have obtained mixed results. We suggest that females differ in the traits they find attractive. To test this proposition, we assessed female zebra finches' preferences for males banded with red or green plastic leg bands and then tested the sex allocation pattern of females paired with preferred and non-preferred males. Although most females preferred redbanded males, 34% of females consistently preferred green-banded males. The sex ratio at laying and hatching was not influenced by paternal preferred status. However, the fledging sex ratios differed between females paired with preferred and non-preferred males due to sex-biased chick mortality; sons of females paired with preferred males were born heavier and were more likely to survive than daughters. Our results indicate that female zebra finches show individual variation in their preferences for colour banded males, although females do not seem to adjust the offspring sex ratio in response to their mate's band colour. However, the differential posthatch mortality suggests females may differentially allocate resources into male and female eggs according to their individual mate preferences.

However, the presence of an observer, if detected by the observed individuals, can influence the nature of the behavior of the observed individuals, called audience effect. In zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata castanotis), domesticated males show an audience effect during mate choice. However, whether male and female descendants of the wild form show an audience effect during mate choice is unknown. Therefore, we conducted an experiment where male and female focal birds could choose between two distinctive phenotypes of the opposite sex, an artificially adorned stimulus bird with a red feather on the forehead and an unadorned stimulus bird, two times consecutively, once without an audience and once with an audience bird (same sex as test bird). Males showed an audience effect when an audience male was present and spent more time with adorned and less time with unadorned females compared to when there was no audience present. The change in time spent with the respective stimulus females was positively correlated with the time that the audience male spent in front of its cage close to the focal male. Females showed no change in mate choice when an audience female was present, but their motivation to associate with both stimulus males decreased. In a control for mate-choice consistency there was no audience in either test. Here, both focal females and focal males chose consistently without a change in choosing motivation. Our results showed that there is an audience effect on mate choice in zebra finches and that the response to a same-sex audience was sex-specific.  2016 Kniel et al.

However, it is still unknown what kind of information drives the decision of an individual to copy the mate choice of others. Among zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata castanotis), only females (not males) copy the mate choice of others. We tested female zebra finches in a binary choice test where they, first, could choose between two males of different phenotypes: one unadorned male and one male artificially adorned with a red feather on the forehead. After this mate-choice test, females could observe a single unadorned male and a pair of zebra finches, i.e. a wild-type female and her adorned mate. Pair interactions were either restricted to acoustic and visual communication (clear glass screen between pair mates) or acoustic communication alone (opaque screen between pair mates). After the observation period, females could again choose between new males of the two phenotypes in a second mate-choice test. Results: In experiments with a clear glass screen, time spent with the respective males changed between the two mate-choice tests, and females preferred adorned over unadorned males during the second mate-choice test. In experiments with an opaque screen, time spent with the respective males did not change between the two mate-choice tests, although females lost an initial preference for unadorned males. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the quality of the received public information (visual and acoustic interaction of the observed pair) influences mate-choice copying in female zebra finches.  2015 Kniel et al.",NA,NA,NA,"Westneat, D.F., Walters, A., McCarthy, T.M., Hatch, M., Hein, W.K., Alternative mechanisms of nonindependent mate choice (2000) Anim Behav, 59, pp. 467-476; Vakirtzis, A., Mate choice copying and nonindependent mate choice: a critical review (2011) Ann Zool Fennici, 48, pp. 91-107; Witte, K., Nbel, S., (2011) Learning and mate choice, pp. 85-107. , In: Brown C, Laland K, Krause J, editors.

One of the most replicated experiments in behavioral ecology is the presumed manipulation of male attractiveness in zebra finches by adding red or green color bands. Red-banded males were found to have higher fitness than green-banded males, and most empirical evidence suggests that this effect is mediated by female mating preferences rather than by male-male competition. A recent study, however, reported that color bands affected male courtship rate and body mass independently of female behavior. If this effect was real, some earlier findings of female preferences and maternal effects on offspring traits could potentially be reinterpreted as being mediated indirectly via effects on male behavior. This new perspective seems appealing also in light of a growing interest in bi-directional feedback mechanisms between endocrinology and ornamentation. However, here we report four independent failures to replicate this effect of color bands on courtship rate and body mass. Combining this new experimental data with all the published evidence in a meta-analysis shows that color bands seem to affect neither male courtship rate (average effect size d = 0.02) nor male body mass (d = -0.07). The present case is a reminder that replication of experiments lies at the heart of distinguishing between real effects and false positive findings.  2012 Seguin, Forstmeier.","animal behavior;  animal experiment;  article;  body mass;  breeding;  color band;  controlled study;  courtship;  ecology;  effect size;  female;  finch;  male;  mate choice;  mathematical analysis;  nonhuman;  parameters;  physical attractiveness;  poephila castanotis;  social environment, Animals;  Body Weight;  Color;  Courtship;  Female;  Finches;  Male;  Mating Preference, Animal;  Sexual Behavior, Animal;  Social Behavior",NA,NA,"Kelly, C.D., Replicating empirical research in behavioral ecology: How and why it should be done but rarely ever is (2006) Quarterly Review of Biology, 81, pp. 221-236; Owens, I.P.F., Where is behavioural ecology going?

However, attractiveness is not a fixed trait. Previous work has shown that male birds can adjust the intensity of their courtship display in response to variation in female behaviour, but little is known about how males adjust their behaviour during mate choice in response to social feedback about their own attractiveness independent of their intrinsic quality. Such information may help to maximize the potential mating success of males. Here, we provide experimental evidence that the amount of attention given by male zebra finches to females is dependent upon the manipulated attractiveness of males. This demonstrates that, in this socially monogamous species of bird, attractiveness of males could be considered to be a social construct, at least partially determined via social feedback from females.  2010 Springer-Verlag.","behavioral ecology;  behavioral response;  experimental study;  mate choice;  monogamy;  passerine;  reproductive success, Aves;  Taeniopygia guttata","Natural Environment Research CouncilNatural Environment Research Council,NERC,NE/F016514/1",NA,"Burley, N.T., Foster, V.S., Variation in female choice of mates:Condition influences selectivity (2006) Anim Behav, 72, pp. 713-719; Burley, N., Krantzberg, G., Radman, P., Influence of colour-banding on the conspecific preferences of zebra finches (1982) Anim Behav, 30, pp. 444-455; Buston, P.M., Emlen, S.T., Cognitive processes underlying human mate choice:The relationship between self-perception and mate preference in Western society (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 100, pp. 8805-8810; Campbell, D.L.M., Hauber, M.E., The disassociation of visual and acoustic conspecific cues decreases discrimination by female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) (2009) J Comp Psychol, 123, pp. 310-315; Clayton, N.S., Mate choice and pair formation in Timor and Australian mainland zebra finches (1990) Anim Behav, 39, pp. 474-480; Collins, S.A., Male displays: Cause or effect of female preference?

The addition of artificial ornaments has been assumed to manipulate a females' perception of the male, rather than affecting intrinsic qualities of the male himself. Here, however, we reveal that the artificial band color worn by a male changes his body mass, condition, and courtship display rate. Males wearing red color bands in aviaries prior to mate-choice trials had a significantly higher song rate during trials than those wearing green color bands, alongside a significant increase in mass change and condition. Male song rate was found to significantly correlate with female preference alongside a female preference for red-banded males. However, male song rate in turn increased when female response was positive, suggesting a social feedback between the interacting birds. Our data suggest the presence of socially mediated feedback mechanisms whereby the artificial increase in attractiveness or dominance of a male directly affects other aspects of his attractiveness. Therefore, housing birds in social groups while manipulating attractiveness can directly influence other male qualities and should be accounted for by future studies.","behavioral response;  body condition;  body mass;  mate choice;  passerine, Aves;  Taeniopygia guttata",National Eye Research CentreNational Eye Research Centre,"Australian Research Council Discovery Project Grant DP0558434 to S.C.G, an NERC studentship to E.C.P., and a Macquarie University Research Excellence Scholarship to M.M.M.","Andersson, M., Female choice selects for extreme tail length in a widowbird (1982) Nature, 299, pp. 818-820; Balzer, A.L., Williams, T.D., Do female zebra finches vary primary reproductive effort in relation to mate attractiveness?

As the quality of an individual influences the payoffs associated with the actions it can perform, its appearance should also influence its behavior. Here we investigate whether male zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, change their behavior (and their energetic states) after artificial manipulations of their appearance, using different colored leg bands, and if such effects carry over after the end of the manipulation, as might be expected if appearance-mediated social dynamics ""lock"" individuals into different states. During three experimental phases, in which all males in a group wore neutral colored leg bands at the beginning (phase I), then wore attractive, unattractive, and neutral colored bands, respectively (phase II), before wearing the neutral color again (phase III), we found no evidence of an effect of the appearance manipulation on state, weight or any behavioral traits we measured. Nevertheless, we found that individuals that stored more fat were more likely to initiate and win aggressive interactions but were less likely to be recipients of aggression. This association between energetic state and aggressive behavior is discussed from both strategic body mass regulation and sexual selection perspectives.

For instance, some birds are naturally sensitive to leg colour, with some colours being more visible or attractive than others. The colour of the leg-rings used to mark birds may thus be related to behavioural and reproductive variables. Most studies have investigated this effect for adults during reproduction, but leg-ring colour may also affect the behaviour of young birds. We tested the potential effect of leg-ring colours on the within-brood dominance hierarchy of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) ducklings while each brood formed a stable and exclusive family unit with its mother. Ducklings did not acquire a within-brood dominance rank according to the colour of their own ring. This result suggests that mallards may not have a sensory bias for a given colouration. However, ducklings wearing a ring of the same colour as one of the two rings of their mother were dominant over their siblings. We discuss the potential behavioural and methodological implications of this result.  2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, in species with lifetime monogamy, such as the zebra finch, partner quality will typically remain the same. In this case, the compensatory investment (CI) hypothesis predicts higher investment for low-quality males, because low genetic quality offspring are more dependent on maternal resources. Here, we show that female zebra finches invested more resources, both in terms of egg volume and yolk carotenoid content, when paired to a low genetic quality male, as judged from his previous ability to obtain extra-pair paternity in aviary colonies. We also found that females deposited slightly larger amounts of testosterone into eggs when paired to a low parental quality male, as judging from his previous success in rearing offspring. This is, to our knowledge, the first experimental support for the CI hypothesis in a species with lifetime monogamy. We stress that in more promiscuous species, the benefits of classical differential allocation may partly be neutralized by the supposed benefits of CI.  2008 The Royal Society.","carotenoid;  compensation;  egg production;  egg size;  maternal effect;  monogamy;  parental investment;  passerine;  resource allocation, Taeniopygia guttata",NA,NA,"Balzer, A.L., Williams, T.D., Do female zebra finches vary primary reproductive effort in relation to mate attractiveness?

In the female choice experiment, we gave captive females a choice between males with normal or dulled epaulets, and between males with normal or reddened epaulets. Females tended to associate more with normal males than with dulled males, but were equally likely to perform precopulatory displays to the two types of males. Females associated significantly more with redder-than-normal males and were more likely to perform precopulatory displays to reddened males. In the male-male competition experiment, we presented free-living territorial males with a male model to which we could attach wings with dulled, normal or reddened epaulets. Presence of the model with reddened epaulets resulted in significant increases in display rates by territory owners, but the increase in display rates was probably in response to males other than the territory owner flying through and trespassing rather than to the reddened epaulet model per se. Normal epaulets produced a significant decrease in song rates and approach distances of owners. Responses of territorial and other males did not differ significantly during normal and dulled epaulet presentations. These results support the hypothesis that epaulets of male red-winged blackbirds are salient inter- and intrasexual signals: unusually red epaulets were attractive to females and attracted more attention and aggression from male conspecifics than normal epaulets. Epaulet colour may thus be an example of intrasexual selection opposing intersexual selection.  2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","aggression;  color;  conspecific;  experimental study;  female behavior;  intersexual interaction;  intrasexual interaction;  male;  mate choice;  passerine, Agelaius;  Agelaius phoeniceus","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation,IBN9306620","We thank Richard D.

Yet, recent experimental studies revealed that social information can play a role in the evolution of mate preferences in monogamous species with biparental care. However, this phenomenon has been demonstrated only under particular conditions and the prevalence and importance of this phenomenon therefore remains to be evaluated. In particular, previous laboratory experiments have consisted in exposing test females to only one paired male at a time, while under natural conditions monogamous females are likely to observe the choice of several females before making a decision. Thus, in the present study, female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) could observe two model females simultaneously, that provided either inconsistent or consistent information, depending on whether they were interacting with different types of males or with males of a same phenotype. We found that the relative importance given to private and social information on females' preferences varied with the consistency of social information and females significantly changed their preference only when social information was consistent. There was, nevertheless, a large variation in their responses. We suggest that such variations could be due to the fact that the benefits of mate-choice copying are frequency-dependent, and that this constrain would further contribute to limit the use of social information in monogamous species.  2008 Springer-Verlag.","behavioral ecology;  bird;  evolutionary biology;  mate choice;  parental care;  phenotype;  plasticity, Taeniopygia guttata",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"Acknowledgments We thank Sophie St-Cyr for her assistance during the experiments, Nadia Aubin-Horth, Wolfgang Forstmeier and an anonymous referee for their constructive comments on a previous version of the manuscript.

The zebra finch, Taeniopgyia guttata, is a classic avian model species for investigating mate choice and sexual selection, but to date virtually all work has been carried out using domesticated birds, and there are inconsistencies in the findings between studies. We tested three different methods for measuring female preferences in this species using both wild and domesticated birds. The first method was a traditional two-way mate choice chamber, where we measured the time spent with each male. The second method was a no-choice chamber where a single male and female were placed in the same cage for 5 min, such that the pair could physically interact, and the female's sexual response was recorded. The third method was an aviary set-up, comprising eight birds (four males and four females), and we recorded the number of pair-bonding behaviours observed over a 24-h period. In the aviary, we found that birds formed pair bonds almost exclusively with their own type (wild males paired with wild females, and domestic males paired with domestic females). In the two-way choice chamber, this assortative mating preference was only shown by domestic females, and in the no-choice test, only wild females showed this assortative mating preference. We discuss the possible reasons for these differences between mate choice tests and make recommendations for future studies on mate choice.  2007 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","behavioral response;  domestic species;  mate choice;  passerine;  preference behavior;  sexual selection;  wild population, Aves;  Taeniopygia guttata",Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourAssociation for the Study of Animal Behaviour,"We thank Jan Nedved and Golden Cob for support with animal husbandry.

Previous studies on red bishops have revealed that male reproductive success is mainly determined by the number of nests built in a territory, and that reproductive success and the number of nests both vary substantially among males. Here we test whether the high variation observed in reproductive performance is related to male behavioural patterns (as assessed by time-budget analysis) and/or nest-building efficiency (as assessed by the number of fibres incorporated in the nest in unit time). We collected data on male time budgets and analysed behavioural patterns for three breeding seasons. A greater number of nests built was positively related to both the amount of time allocated to nest-building behaviour and the efficiency of nest building. Neither the amount of time spent in courtship behaviour nor the amount of time spent in male-male interactions was related to reproductive success. Male reproductive success, irrespective of the number of nests built, was partly determined by the number of fibres incorporated, suggesting some importance of nest quality in terms of nest chamber density to male reproductive success. There were no trade-offs with regard to time allocated to different behaviour. Instead, males differed with regard to their territory attendance and activity levels, which might be because of differences in energy resources and may thus reflect inherent differences in male body condition and, ultimately, male genetic quality.

This has been disputed by findings showing that colours other than red can also provide a competitive advantage. Here we examine basic perception of red versus blue in simple shapes by human judges to address the social signalling properties of red. We show that red is seen as more likely to win in physical competitions, more aggressive and more dominant then blue. When hue information is removed, however, the darker contrast of the blue shapes leads to a reversal in the attributions. This confirms that red hue is special in social attribution consistent with it being a signal of competitive quality and that darker contrast, through a potential link to testosterone signalling, could also act as a signal of dominance.  2007 Akadmiai Kiad.",NA,NA,NA,"Adams, F.M., Osgood, C.E., Cross-cultural study of affective meanings of color (1973) Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 4, pp. 135-156; Barton, R.A., Hill, R.A., Sporting contests Seeing red?

Alternative colour morphs of the pygmy grasshopper, Tetrix subulata, represent ecological strategies that differ in body size, life history, thermoregulatory behaviour, and habitat selection. The hypothesis that selection promotes behaviours maintaining coadapted gene complexes predicts individuals to mate assortatively with respect to colour morph. On the other hand, the bet-hedging hypothesis predicts that the temporal variability of the environment inhabited by these animals may select for disassortative mating behaviour resulting in heterogeneous offspring. To distinguish between these competing hypotheses, we investigated mating behaviours using dual-choice experiments. Our results were not in agreement with the prediction of assortative mating but suggest instead that matings were random with regard to colour morph. Polyandry was common, and females mated with the second male regardless of whether the first mating was assortative or disassortative. Polyandry also was equally frequent among females in triads in which the two males belonged to different colour morphs as in triads where both males belonged to the same colour morph. A field experiment confirmed that polyandry occurred also among free-ranging individuals, and uncovered variation in mating success among male colour morphs, probably due to indirect effects of coloration on activity or habitat use. The consequences of this random and polyandrous mating strategy for the evolutionary dynamics of the colour polymorphism remain to be explored.  2007 The Linnean Society of London.","assortative mating;  bet-hedging;  color morph;  environmental factor;  genotype-environment interaction;  grasshopper;  habitat selection;  natural selection;  polyandry;  polymorphism;  reproductive strategy, Animalia;  Tetrigidae;  Tetrix subulata",NA,NA,"Ahnesj, J., Forsman, A., Correlated evolution of color pattern and body size in polymorphic pygmy grasshoppers (2003) Tetrix undulata.

This book bridges that gap. It describes Bayesian approaches to analysing averages, frequencies, regression, correlation and analysis of variance in ecology. The book also incorporates case studies to demonstrate mark-recapture analysis, development of population models and the use of subjective judgement. The advantages of Bayesian methods, including the incorporation of any relevant prior information and the ability to assess the evidence in favour of competing hypotheses, are also described here. The analyses described in this book use the freely available software WinBUGS, and there is an accompanying website (http://arcue.botany.unimelb.edu.au/bayes.html) containing the data files and WinBUGS codes that are used in the book. The Bayesian methods described here will be of use to ecologists from the level of upper undergraduate and above.  M. A.

The study analyzed - and remote-controlled video cameras filmed - the behavior of lizards housed in 3 outdoor enclosures, from May to September 2000. Daily activity showed a bimodal or unimodal pattern, all specimens basking more during June, with the largest male was the most active. Adults ate a higher percentage of vegetable items; subadults, a comparatively larger proportion of larvae and adult insects. The study analyzed individual compatibility; all interacted during 2 short periods. Aggression occurred mainly between males; because most directed high-intensity aggression toward a specific lizard, the study recommended isolating this lizard in a separate enclosure. The study recommended keeping 2 male-female pairs, who demonstrated social tolerance, as breeding pairs in separated terraria. Typical courtship behavior (head-bob sequences) occurred mainly during July, with highest frequency by the oldest male. Behavioral assessment provided data for improving the individuals' welfare in the enclosures and to select specific pairs for breeding.

We tested whether male and female zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata sexually imprinted on an evolutionary novel trait, a blue feather on the forehead in parents. Additionally, we tested whether males and females would transfer a learned preference for the blue feather to a preference for blue leg bands, and whether a potential mate with two novel blue traits can amplify its attractiveness. Offspring were raised by parents in four different imprinting groups: (1) both parents unadorned; (2) the mother adorned only; (3) the father adorned only; (4) both parents adorned with the blue feather. After young reached maturity, we tested their mate preference for adorned and unadorned conspecifics of the opposite sex in binary choice tests. Females of the father adorned imprinting group sexually imprinted on the blue feather, and females reared by adorned parents showed a tendency to prefer adorned males. None of the males sexually imprinted on the blue feather. Our study replicates the results of a previous study on sexual imprinting on a red feather in zebra finches. We, therefore, propose a sex difference in the learning process of sexual imprinting. Females sexually imprinted on the blue feather did not transfer the learned preference to males with blue leg bands, and two novel blue traits could not amplify the attractiveness in males and females for the opposite sex. Our study emphasizes the role of sexual imprinting for the cultural evolution in mate preferences in zebra finches.

We examined the effects of an aromatase inhibitor, 1,4,6-androstatriene-3,17-dione (ATD), combined with an anti-androgen, flutamide (F), on the behavior and pairing status of initially unpaired male and female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). In the first experiment, 24 adult males were implanted with either a combination of ATD and flutamide or empty implants. Two weeks after implantation, birds were housed in aviaries containing 3 ATD+F males, 3 control males, and 3 females and allowed 2 weeks to pair, with observations 7 times during the 2-week period. A second experiment tested the effects of these same treatments in females. During the first 4days of testing, ATD+F males were less likely to attack conspecifics than were control males. ATD+F males were also less likely to ""greet,"" or approach, females than were control males, but other courtship behaviors, including directed singing, were unaffected. ATD+F females did not differ from control females on any courtship behavior measured. Furthermore, these treatments did not affect pairing behaviors (time spent clumping or in a nest box together) or the likelihood of pairing with a partner of the opposite sex. ATD+F treatments in females did, however, increase the likelihood of same-sex pairing. This suggests that, although sex steroids may regulate some courtship behaviors in males, they do not regulate pairing behaviors and have little effect on the likelihood that a male or female will be chosen as a mate by a bird of the opposite sex.  2006 Elsevier Inc.

In the first experiment, adults in one breeding colony wore white crests with a vertical black stripe, while in another colony adults wore crests having a horizontal black stripe; except for their crests, breeders possessed wild-type plumage and conformation. Offspring of both sexes reared in these colonies developed mate preferences for opposite-sexed birds wearing the crest type with which they were reared; neither sex developed a social preference for crested individuals of the same sex. In a second experiment, females reared by crested parents preferred crested males versus males with red leg bands, while control females (reared in a colony of wild-type, uncrested birds) preferred red-banded males in the same test. Results of a third experiment that used sexually dimorphic crest phenotypes indicate that both sexes of offspring imprinted on maternal crest patterns. Results support the hypothesis that sexual imprinting can facilitate isolation both by engendering a preference for population-typical traits and by prioritizing such an imprinting-based preference over species-typical preferences for other traits used in mate choice. Comparison with results of other recent studies indicates that imprinting tendencies of both sexes vary with the characteristics of traits presented as an imprinting stimuli. Tendency to imprint may vary with the perceived information content (e.g., kin, sex, or population indicator) of parental traits, a process dubbed selective sexual imprinting.  2006 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

Egg laying is costly for birds, as eggs must contain all the energy and nutrients needed by the developing embryo. As nutrients are limiting, there is a conflict between provisioning eggs and conserving nutrients for future health and survival. 2. Life-history theory suggests that females should choose how to invest resources in relation to the value of the reproductive attempt. Females may manipulate egg composition in relation to the attractiveness of their mate, ensuring chick survival and assuming that the offspring will themselves be more attractive and have higher reproductive success. Antioxidants are an important component of egg composition: they are vital for embryonic and posthatching chick development and survival. 3. Here we demonstrate that female Zebra Finches (Taeniopygia guttata) mated to attractive males deposit more carotenoids and alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) in later-laid eggs, shown by a significant interaction between laying order and antioxidant concentration. This bias may increase the probability of chick survival from later-laid eggs and potentially the lifetime reproductive success of the laying female. 4. The body condition of the laying female, measured as fat reserves, was found to be a significant predictor of yolk carotenoid concentration but not of yolk alpha-tocopherol concentration.  2006 British Ecological Society.","antioxidant;  carotenoid;  egg development;  energy;  maternal effect;  nutrient;  reproductive success;  survival;  vitamin, Aves;  Bias;  Taeniopygia guttata",NA,NA,"Andersson M, (1992) Sexual Selection, , Princeton University Press Princeton, NJ, USA; Bahr J, M., Wang, S.C., Huang, M.Y., Calvo, F.O., Steroid concentrations in isolated theca and granulosa layers of preovulatory follicles during the ovulatory cycle of the domestic hen (1983) Biology of Reproduction, 29, pp. 327-334; Blount J, D., Surai, P.F., Nager, R.G., Carotenoids and egg quality in the lesser black-backed gull Larus fuscus: A supplemental feeding study (2002) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B, 269, pp. 29-36; Blount J, D., Houston, D.C., Surai, P.F., Moller, A.P., Egg-laying capacity is limited by carotenoid pigment availability in wild gulls Larus fuscus (2004) Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series B, 271, pp. 71-S81; Burley N, The differential-allocation hypothesis: An experimental test (1988) American Naturalist, 132, pp. 611-628; Burley N, Krantzberg, G., Radman, P., Influence of colour-banding on the conspecific preferences of zebra finches (1982) Animal Behaviour, 30, pp. 444-455; Cunningham J, A.E., Russell, A.F., Egg investment is influenced by male attractiveness in the mallard (2000) Nature, 404, pp. 74-76; Feingold I, B., Longhurst, P.A., Colby, H.D., Regulation of adrenal and hepatic alpha-tocopherol content by androgens and estrogens (1993) Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1176, pp. 192-196; Gil D, Graves, J., Hazon, N., Wells, A., Mate attractiveness and differential testosterone investment in zebra finch eggs (1999) Science, 286, pp. 126-128; Gil D, Leboucher, G., Lacroix, A., Cue, R., Kreutzer, M., Female canaries produce eggs with greater amounts of testosterone when exposed to preferred male song (2004) Hormones and Behaviour, 45, pp. 64-70; Grafen A, Hails, R., (2002) Modern Statistics for the Life Sciences, , Oxford University Press Oxford, UK; Graves J, Whiten, A., Henzi, P., Why does the herring gull lay three eggs?

Mothers are predicted to invest differentially in offspring in ways that will maximize offspring fitness depending on the environment she expects them to encounter. Here, we test for maternal effects in response to mate attractiveness on offspring developmental traits in the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata. We controlled for parental genetic quality by manipulating male attractiveness using coloured leg rings and by randomly assigning mating pairs. The potential confounding effect of differential nestling care was controlled for by cross-fostering clutches and by allowing for variance due to foster father attractiveness in general linear models. We found a difference in egg mass investment between attractiveness groups and, importantly, we found that all of the offspring traits we measured varied with the attractiveness of the father. This provides strong evidence for maternal effects in response to mate attractiveness. Furthermore, due to the experiment design, we can conclude that these effects were mediated by differential investment of egg resources and not due to genetic differences or differences in nestling care.  2006 The Royal Society.","egg;  fitness;  male behavior;  maternal effect;  nestling;  parental investment;  passerine;  phenotype, animal behavior;  animal experiment;  article;  body size;  bone growth;  controlled study;  female;  genetic difference;  genetic manipulation;  genetic trait;  male;  nestling;  nonhuman;  oocyte development;  priority journal;  progeny;  sexual behavior;  sexual maturation;  sexuality;  survival;  zebra fish;  animal;  breeding;  color;  feeding behavior;  finch;  growth, development and aging;  histology;  oocyte;  physiology;  reproduction;  sexual behavior, Taeniopygia guttata, Animals;  Body Size;  Breeding;  Color;  Feeding Behavior;  Female;  Finches;  Male;  Ovum;  Reproduction;  Sexual Behavior, Animal",NA,NA,"Alekseev, V., Lampert, W., Maternal control of resting-egg production in Daphnia (2001) Nature, 414, pp. 899-901. , doi:10.1038/414899a; Balzer, A.L., Williams, T.D., Do female zebra finches vary in primary reproductive effort in relation to mate attractiveness?

In birds, parents have been shown to invest more into egg production and nestling care when paired with an attractive rather than an unattractive mate, as predicted by the differential allocation hypothesis. Here we investigate variation in the female's and male's share of incubation behaviour, a vital, and costly, period of parental care during which the embryo is vulnerable to perturbations in developmental conditions. We manipulated the attractiveness of male zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata, using red or green leg-rings. To simulate their natural social environment we allowed them to breed in outdoor aviaries. All males within an aviary were given the same coloured ring to avoid ring-colour related assortative mating. Males within a colony, however, were still expected to show some variation in attractiveness with the earliest laying females possibly pairing with the most attractive males. Indeed we found that both factors played a role in explaining female incubation effort. Among females mated to red ringed males, earlier laying females contributed significantly more to incubation than late laying females, but no such pattern was found in females mated to green ringed males. Overall, there were no differences in the level of incubation provided by both parents between treatment groups, suggesting some compensation within the pair. Hatching success was correlated with a pair's total incubation effort. These results suggest that variation in the division of parental care between the sexes is in agreement with both increased effort of females mated with attractive males, and females compensating for the reduced effort of attractive males seeking further mating opportunities. These two factors can act at the same time in natural populations and both should be considered when explaining variation in division of labour between the sexes.

A multitude of hypotheses have been put forward to explain this variation, but its occurrence is not fully understood. Male age, social dominance rank, song and breeding density or synchrony have been among the suggested correlates of EPP, but results so far are inconclusive. We interspecifically cross-fostered blue tits (Parus caeruleus) and great tits (Parus major) in the wild, thus manipulating males to exhibit reduced social dominance rank, sing aberrant songs, and consequently be perceived as low-quality males as compared to controls. This allowed us to test if male quality had an influence on loss of paternity. We found no statistically significant differences between cross-fostered and control males of either species, neither with respect to levels of cuckoldry nor proportions of extrapair young (EPY) in the broods. Paternity levels were comparable to other studies on the same species. No effect of density could be detected on levels of EPP either, while an age effect seemed to be present at least in the blue tit, EPY being almost absent in broods of older blue tit males. We conclude that the effects of male quality on paternity loss are minor, if any, in these populations.  The Author 2005.

Previous studies on zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, in which colored leg rings were used to alter male attractiveness, support this hypothesis. However, because molecular sexing techniques were not available, it was not known when during development this bias arose. Also, because both attractive (red-ringed) and unattractive (green-ringed) males were within the same aviary, assortative mating between treatments may have confounded the results. Using two different experimental designs, we tested whether the sex ratio of zebra finch eggs and chicks differed in response to paternal ring color whilst controlling for assortative mating between treatments. In the aviary experiment, birds could interact socially, but all males in an aviary had the same leg ring color. In the cage experiment, each female was randomly assigned a red- or green-ringed mate, thus also eliminating assortative mating within treatments. Offspring were sexed based on plumage or using a molecular method. The sex ratio at laying did not differ between treatments in either the aviary (n = 313 eggs) or cage (n = 151 eggs) experiments, suggesting that female zebra finches do not manipulate the primary sex ratio in response to their mate's ring color. However, in the cage experiment we found greater male embryonic mortality in the attractive group, which resulted in a female-biased sex ratio at sexual maturity, that is, in the opposite direction to that found in previous studies. Possible explanations for the disparity between our results and those of previous studies are considered.  The Author 2005.

If females acquire preferences through social mechanisms, sexual selection could act very rapidly to spread the preference and drive elaboration of the preferred trait (s). Although there are reports of 'mate-choice copying' in polygynous species, there is no clear evidence for this process in monogamous species. Here, we investigated whether adult female zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata can socially acquire sexual preferences for individual males and, in a separate study, for a generalized trait (coloured leg bands) of males. In both studies, test females observed males in two simultaneous conditions: a ('chosen') mixed-sex situation in which a male was paired with a (model) female, and a ('unchosen') same-sex situation in which a male was paired with another male. In the first experiment, after two weeks of females observing males, test females significantly preferred individual males who had been paired with another female (i.e. chosen males). In the second experiment, test females significantly preferred novel males that were wearing the same leg band colour as the apparently chosen males. Our findings are consistent with the conclusion that female zebra finches' mate preferences are altered by public information.

We conducted a large number of mate choice trials involving unmanipulated stimulus males, and found low but significant consistency (repeatability of time allocation by a female tested twice with the same set of males R = 0.29), and very low but significant between-female agreement (different females tested with the same set of males: R = 0.11). Although low individual consistency indicates that preferences were relatively weak or hard to measure, we found significant repeatability of individual preference functions with regard to beak colour, song rate and male aggressiveness when individual females were tested twice with different sets of males. This means that some females consistently preferred red-beaked males whereas others preferred orange-beaked males, some preferred high and others low song rates, and some preferred aggressive and others less aggressive males. Of these male traits, only song rate was positively related to average male attractiveness. Low between-female agreement did not seem to result from assortative mating for quality, because there was no repeatability of an individual female's preference for attractive or unattractive males. It is possible that disagreement follows from choice for genetic compatibility, but much of it could also result from weak preferences and little variation in male quality.  2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Using the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata, as a model, I investigated the mechanisms with which males tried to persuade females to copulate with them. Analysing the outcome of a large number of experimental male-female encounters, I concluded that apart from some effect of male choosiness (preference for certain females), females were fully in control of copulation. Males did not differ in their abilities to overcome female resistance, either in terms of sensory exploitation (variation in ornamentation and display) or coercion (use of aggression). Variation in beak colour had no influence on male mating success, but male song rate may be a sexually selected trait: males that sang more frequently obtained more copulations, but this was because other males missed opportunities by not even attempting to display to females. Whenever a male started displaying, female responsiveness, and hence male copulatory success, was not influenced by how persistently he sang. These findings support a theory of chase-away sexual selection, rather than a good-genes theory, which has typically been invoked to explain variation in male song rate. Between-individual differences in male song rate may reflect alternative reproductive strategies (mating effort versus parental effort) rather than variation in male quality. Finally, I found marked differences in sexual responsiveness between females, which is not anticipated by current models of sexual selection and hence urges further investigation.  2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Females are also predicted to invest more in sons than in daughters under such conditions, because male offspring should have higher fitness returns than female offspring when fathered by an attractive male. We examined primary resource allocation in zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, when mated to both an attractive and an unattractive male. In the first breeding round, as predicted, females mated to attractive males laid heavier eggs, and there was a positive relation between female mass and egg mass. In contrast, for females mated to unattractive males there was no correlation between egg mass and body mass. Mate attractiveness did not affect clutch size or yolk androgen investment. Unexpectedly, in the second breeding round, in which the same females were paired with different males of opposite attractiveness to those in the first round, females did not alter their individual patterns of investment in egg mass. Therefore, we suggest there may be a physiological carryover effect and that females were primed by their first reproductive experience. In both rounds of breeding there was no difference in egg mass or yolk androgen concentration between male or female eggs in either treatment. Similarly, the primary sex ratio did not differ between treatments. This suggests that females do not differentially invest in male and female offspring in relation to the attractiveness of their mate in this species.  2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

One group of females was exposed during 6 days to both acoustic and visual stimuli from males while another was exposed only to acoustic stimuli; a control group was unable to see or hear males prior to the introduction of unfamiliar males for pairing. We also manipulated the amount of visual stimulation by presenting either: males with normal red bands, males with red bands without ultraviolet reflection or unadorned males. Females exposed to visual stimuli spent more time on perches near males than control females or those only hearing males. However, there were no statistically significant differences in subsequent total eggs produced, or the latency to egg-laying between females exposed to priming males with different visual characteristics; they did not significantly differ from the control females in these parameters either. Females that heard, but did not see, priming stimuli produced more eggs when paired with males than the controls. Thus, acoustic stimuli alone may have promoted reproductive condition while the acoustic and visual stimuli together did not. Our results contradict a previous report, and may reflect components of the experimental design we employed (i.e. by pairing females with unfamiliar males after their initial exposure to priming males, we may have suppressed their ability to advance their reproductive state). Females that only heard priming males may have been more willing to accept pairing males because of the absence of visual identifiers.

Of 55 recaptures of 42 individuals, 22 (40%) had lost at leastone of its colour rings. Females showed a tendency to remove colour rings more frequently than males. For both sexes, there was a similar tendency to remove more dark than lightcoloured rings. While it is not possible to identify a specific reason why the birds remove their colour rings, it is possible that discomfort on the nest may play a role in ring removal by females and, more speculatively, it is possible that males might remove colour rings to manipulate their sexual attractiveness to females. Wraparound rings might provide a solution to the problem of colourringing species with powerful beaks.  2004 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","bird;  ringing, Aves;  Carduelis;  Carduelis chloris;  Chloris",NA,NA,"Bennett, A.T.D., Cuthill, I.C., Ultraviolet vision in birds: What is its function?

Experimental trials consisted of four 30-min stages: (A) acclimation, (B) observer female chooses between two males, (C) observer female watches a model female interact with her nonpreferred male from stage B, and (D) observer female again chooses between the two males. Control trials were identical except that there was no model female in stage C. Females in both experimental and control trials spent significantly more time with the nonpreferred male in stage D than they had in stage B; thus, our experiment appeared to reveal no evidence of mate choice copying. There was, however, a significant positive relationship between the increase in the time that an observer female in experimental trials spent with her nonpreferred male in stage D and the number of interactions that she had previously observed between the model female and that male in stage C. A second experiment of similar design, where observer females were prevented from observing the model female and nonpreferred male interact in stage B, demonstrated that the behaviour of the observer female in the first experiment was not simply a response to changes in male behaviour in stage D. While our experiment does not support the hypothesis that female zebra finches copy each other's mate preferences, our findings suggest that public information may influence the behaviour of female zebra finches toward potential mates.","Biodiversity;  Physiological models, Control trails;  Experimental trails;  Mating;  Zoology, Ecology, learning;  mate choice;  preference behavior, Fringillidae;  Taeniopygia;  Taeniopygia guttata",NA,NA,"Agrawal, A.F., The evolutionary consequences of mate copying on male traits (2001) Behav.

Parents reared young in one of four imprinting groups: (1) both parents adorned with the red feather; (2) the father only adorned; (3) the mother only adorned; (4) both parents unadorned. After the young matured, we tested their preference for adorned and unadorned conspecifics of the opposite sex in simultaneous double-choice tests. Females but not males sexually imprinted on the red feather when their parents or father were adorned. In further tests, females that had sexually imprinted on the red feather did not generalize from the learned preference for a red feather to a preference for an orange or blue feather. Neither males nor females reared by unadorned parents showed a latent preference for potential mates adorned with a red, orange, or blue feather. Our results show that in the dimorphic zebra finch, only females sexually imprint on a novel trait. Sexual imprinting can support the evolution of novel male traits and would enhance the dimorphism in this species.  2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Since molecular sexing techniques removed this constraint, the last 5 years has seen a great increase in studies of clutch sex ratio manipulation by female birds. Typically these studies investigate variation in clutch sex ratios across individuals in relation to environmental characteristics or parental traits, and often they find no relationships. In this study we also found that clutch sex ratios did not vary in relation to a number of biological and environmental factors for 238 great tit Parus major nests. However, interesting sex ratio biases were revealed when variation in clutch sex ratios was analyzed within individual females breeding in successive years. There was a significant positive relationship between the change in sex ratio of a female's clutch from one year to the next and the relative body condition of her partner. Females mating with males of higher body condition in year x + 1 produced relatively male-biased sex ratios, and the opposite was true for females mated with lower condition males. Within-individual analysis also allowed investigations of sex ratio in relation to partner change. There was no change in sex ratios of females pairing with the same male; however, females pairing with a new male produced clutches significantly more female biased. Comparisons of clutch sex ratios within individuals may be a powerful method for detecting sex ratio variation, and perhaps female birds may indeed manipulate egg sex but require personal contextual experience for such decisions.","body condition;  individual variation;  parent-offspring interaction;  parental investment;  paternal effect;  reproduction;  sex ratio, Aves;  Parus;  Parus major",NA,NA,"Appleby, B.M., Petty, S.J., Blakey, J.K., Rainey, P., Macdonald, D.W., Does variation of sex ratio enhance reproductive success of offspring in tawny owls (Strix aluco)?

By manipulating their food supply, we forced two groups of females either to increase or to decrease investment in subsequent eggs. Since zebra finches are sexually dimorphic and the reproductive value of the sexes may vary with maternal nutritional status, we predicted that females would adjust the sex of their offspring to egg quality. Females that received poor-quality food for 7 weeks before egg laying, then food supplemented with proteins after they laid the first egg, significantly increased the mass of subsequent eggs. An increase of egg mass with laying sequence was less pronounced in females that received high-quality food before laying and experienced food deterioration after starting to lay. The proportion of sons in subsequent eggs tended to increase in the latter group (although this was marginally significant) but was not related to laying sequence in the other group: these patterns differed significantly between the groups. Offspring sex was not related to egg mass, but newly hatched male chicks were heavier than female chicks. Furthermore, the hatching success of male eggs was lower than that of female eggs. We suggest that differential hatching success of the sexes and sex differences in mass at hatching may constitute important factors shaping brood sex ratios.  2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

In a similar analysis, the likelihood of a bird becoming part of a local breeding population over a 4-yr period was independent of the color of its bands. For nine colors (yellow, orange, red, green, light blue, dark bine, black, pink, and white) analyzed separately, returning or breeding birds did not carry a particular color more often than expected. The use of colored leg bands in this breeding population did not appear to affect return or breeding frequencies of birds wearing at least one of a particular colored leg band.

We captured Semipalmated Sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) chicks at hatch on the Alaskan North Slope and attached 0-3 bands to them. The chicks were resighted and reweighed during the subsequent two weeks. The number of chicks banded varied from 18 to 21 among treatments; 6-9 were resighted, and 6-7 were reweighed, per treatment. The proportion resighted varied from 0.33 to 0.45. The estimated resighting probability, given that we encountered a brood, was 82%. We tested for effects of the bands on survival and mass gain by analyzing whether the proportion of chicks resighted, or their mass, varied with the number of bands. We found no evidence that bands affected the chicks and were able to rule out (with 95% confidence) a decline in survivorship of more than 13% and a loss of mass of more than 10%. Although bands had little if any effect on chicks in our study, we believe their effects should be evaluated whenever survivorship or mass gain are estimated using color-marked chicks.",Aves;  Calidris pusilla;  Gallus gallus;  Scolopacidae,NA,NA,"Amat, J.A., Foot losses of metal banded Snowy Plovers (1999) J.

From a colour band experiment in the field, we have previously reported that male bluethroats, Luscinia s. svecica, with blue and orange bands (BO males) guarded their mates less intensely at the peak of female fertility, and spent more time advertising for additional mates, than males banded with non-BO colours. These responses indicated that BO males experienced less threat to their paternity than did non-BO males, possibly mediated through an increased attractiveness. Here we present paternity analyses of the broods from the field study and test whether there were differences between the two male groups in within-pair or extrapair paternity. There were no significant differences between the two groups of males in paternity, suggesting effective male protection of paternity. However, extrapair paternity was infrequent in the 2 years of the field experiment; hence, the power in detecting effects on paternity does not allow a definitive conclusion on this issue. We also conducted an aviary experiment in which females were given the choice between a BO male and a non-BO male, to test whether females had preferences for particular colour bands. Females did not associate more with BO males, as would have been expected if these males were more attractive in social mate choice. Our results suggest that the effects of colour bands on social mate choice and paternity are, at best, weak.

Experiment Station, Auburn University, Alabama, NY 36849, United States","The bright coloration of plastic leg bands used in avian research has been shown to affect the social interactions of birds by augmenting the ornamentation that traditionally mediates intersexual mate choice and/or intrasexual competition for mates. With ultraviolet (UV) vision and plumage reflectance playing a role in the mating decisions of some species, it would seem important to examine the UV reflectance properties of colored bands, as these bands may be providing strong and meaningful UV color signals that are invisible to the human eye and are potentially unaccounted for in most avian behavioral studies. In this study, we used a fiber optic spectrometer and a UV/visible light source to collect spectral reflectance data for the commonly used types and colors of bands and showed that none exhibit peak reflectance values throughout the range of LV wavelengths that is visible to birds. Instead, UV reflectance of colored bands at these wavelengths is comparable to levels of background reflectance found elsewhere in the avian visible spectrum. Consequently, colored bands lack discrete UV color signals and can safely be used in studies of wild birds with a minimal risk of influencing intraspecific signaling that is based on ultraviolet ornamentation. However, caution must be exercised when using these bands under experimental conditions, as certain treatments (e.g., indoor lighting, one-way glass, sunscreens) may mask the background levels of UV reflectance that still contribute to the overall band color, effectively inducing a color change in the bands that could provide unnatural visual cues to the birds and unintentionally influence their social interactions.",Aves;  Galliformes,NA,NA,"Andersson, S., Bright ultraviolet colouration in the Asian whistling-thrushes (Myiophonus spp.) (1996) Proc.

Females (N=10) were tested separately and moved freely between the chamber's arms, each of which contained a male wearing bands (two per leg) in symmetric; asymmetric or cross-asymmetric configurations. In three of the six tests experienced by each female, one-way glass (mounted diagonally within each arm) prevented males from seeing the female or their own reflection. During the other three tests, transparent glass was used, so males could see and react to the female. A male's band combination had a significant influence on the amount of time that females spent with him, but only during transparent-glass tests, where symmetric males were preferred. The results of our transparent-glass tests were similar to those reported by Swaddle and Cuthill (1994, Nature, 367, 165-166), in a study where females selected between males that were interacting with their own mirror images (reflected by one-way glass). We discuss why females display the same apparent preference when tested with males engaged in intra- (Swaddle and Cuthill's study) versus intersexual activities (our study). Since females in our study displayed a preference only when males could interact with them, caution may be required when extrapolating the results of static choice tests (e.g. involving models, one-way glass or video images) to situations where the participants can interact.","female behavior;  mate choice;  passerine, Fringillidae;  Passeriformes;  Taeniopygia guttata;  Taeniopygia guttata",University of WaikatoUniversity of Waikato,"We thank the Department of Biological Sciences and the University of Waikato for funding the research, and Professor Ray Littler (Statistics Department, University of Waikato) for conducting the statistical analysis.

These earlier studies did not test whether cultural background influenced mate choice in females and therefore whether culture could potentially play a role in sexual selection in this species; as has been suggested by recent theory. Here, we tested whether culture influences female mate choice in brown-headed cowbirds. Female cowbirds from a South Dakota population wet, housed with adult cowbirds from the same South Dakota population or with adult cowbirds from a behaviourally distinct population from Indiana. We tested the mating preferences of females of the South Dakota culture and females of the Indiana culture in sequential mate-choice trials with males, controlling for intrasexual interactions. The males were South Dakota cowbirds that had also been housed either in the South Dakota culture or in the Indiana culture. Females showed mating preferences for males from their own culture. These results suggest that mate choice in female cowbirds can be influenced by cultural background. We briefly discuss the effect that culture may have on sexual selection and on the evolution of female mating preferences.","mate choice;  mating behavior, Molothrus ater",NA,"This study was supported by a doctoral dissertation improvement grant from the National Science Foundation and Animal Behaviour Society research grants to T.M.F.

Behavioural observations showed that the tutee associated more with the adult from which it was subsequently found to have learnt. In a second experiment, birds reared by both parents wearing either light-blue or light-green colour rings and then given a choice of tutors wearing these ring combinations also showed no preference between them. These young males did, however, more often approach the tutor ringed as their parents had been. This may explain why they did not show more interest in the tutor whose song they learnt. The majority of the tutors were used twice, with the ring colour swapped before they were used the second time. There was a strong tendency for the same male to be copied by the two young birds exposed to him. This could not be attributed to a difference in song rate between the two tutors. Further work will be required to discover the basis of that individual's greater attractiveness.","intraspecific interaction;  learning;  male behavior;  passerine;  ringing;  song, Taeniopygia guttata",Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council,"This work was carried out while F.D.P. was in receipt of a St Leonards College scholarship from the University of St Andrews, and was assisted by a grant to P.J.B.S. from BBSRC.

We introduced a red feather as an evolutionarily novel trait in both sexes and tested their preferences for prospective mates with this trait. Males rejected females bearing the red feather and preferred to court unadorned females. In contrast, females partly preferred adorned males. Specifically, previously unattractive males gained in attractiveness and could increase their reproductive success when bearing the ornament, whereas previously attractive males lost in attractiveness, but this did not affect their reproductive success. We introduced two other novel traits in males and investigated the females' response to these in mate choice tests. Each of the three new traits interacted with the natural attractiveness of males. The more attractive a male was before ornamentation, the more it lost in attractiveness after ornamentation and vice versa. Thus, the position of the trait did not affect the interaction. Because males rejected adorned females and females partly preferred adorned males, novel traits might evolve by intersexual selection in males rather than in females. This can lead to a sexual dimorphism with conspicuous traits in males.

In this study, I used a four-choice chamber apparatus to investigate this preference, and to determine whether it is influenced by band coloration. I created band combinations by banding males with four leg bands. The symmetrical combinations consisted of two bands on each leg; the asymmetrical combinations consisted of three bands on one leg and one band on the other leg. For each of the symmetry treatments, all four bands were either light green or red. Females did not spend significantly more time associating with males wearing symmetrical bands or with males wearing red bands. The duration of male-female associations was not influenced by an interaction between symmetry category and band colour treatment. None of 10 females spent the most time with males with red symmetrical bands.","leg band;  symmetry;  zebra finch, Fringillidae;  Passeriformes;  Taeniopygia guttata;  Taeniopygia guttata;  Taeniopygia guttata",NA,"I thank M.

Biology, Inst. of Biomed. and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, United Kingdom","Zebra finches have previously been found to have preferences for particular colours of both natural and artificial traits among opposite sex conspecifics. For example, in some studies female zebra finches preferred males wearing red leg bands to orange-banded and unbanded birds and rejected light green-banded males. In other studies, females also preferred males with red beaks to orange-beaked males. However, several authors have failed to replicate these results. We show that females may fail to show a colour preference because of the absence or removal of ultraviolet light under experimental conditions. In mate-choice trials, females observing males through filters that transmitted ultraviolet preferred red-banded males but where females viewed males through ultraviolet-blocking filters, no such preference was observed. Further investigation revealed that the lack of a colour preference when ultraviolet was absent was probably due to the change in overall appearance of the bird, rather than the change in appearance of the rings themselves. This work highlights the importance of proper consideration of the sensory capabilities of animals in experimental design, particularly with regard to the role of ultraviolet light in avian colour perception.",Animalia;  Aves;  Fringillidae;  Galliformes;  Taeniopygia guttata;  Taeniopygia guttata,7/S05042,"We are very grateful to Julian Partridge, Ron Douglas, Justin Marshall and Sarah Collins for discussions and for the loan of equipment, to Sadie Iles and Rob Massie for animal care and two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

One explanation is that colour-matching with a sexual ornament affects the individual's sexual attractiveness. This study reports a colour-band experiment with free-living bluethroats, Luscinia s. svecica, a species where males have a distinct blue and chestnut throat and upper breast. There was no apparent difference in pairing success between males with ornament-matching colour bands (blue and orange) and males with non-ornamental colour bands. However, males with ornamental bands guarded their mates less intensely and spent more time singing, performing song flights and intruding into neighbours' territories than males with non-ornamental bands. We conclude that colour bands affect the trade-off between mate guarding and advertisement behaviour in a way that is consistent with the hypothesis that bands with ornamental colours improve a male's attractiveness. The results are in concordance with a previous study of the same population, showing that males with experimentally reduced attractiveness guarded their mates more closely and advertised less for additional mates, than non-manipulated males.","attractiveness;  bluethroat;  leg band;  mate guarding;  ornament, Aves;  Luscinia;  Luscinia svecica;  Luscinia svecica svecica;  Luscinia svecica svecica",Norges ForskningsrdNorges Forskningsrd,"We thank Trond Amundsen, Peder Fiske, the Behavioural Ecology group at the Zoological Museum in Oslo and two anonymous referees for discussions and/or comments on the manuscript, StaVan Andersson and Jonas O} rnborg for doing the spectroradiometrical measurements and Hkon rjaster for assistance in the field.

Biol., University of Edinburgh, West Mains Road, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, United Kingdom","When the relative fitness of sons and daughters differs, sex-allocation theory predicts that it would he adaptive for individuals to adjust their investment in different sexes of offspring. Sex ratio adjustment by females in response to the sexual attractiveness of their mate would be an example of this. In vertebrates the existence of this form of sex ratio adjustment is controversial and may be confounded with sex-biased mortality, particularly in sexually size-dimorphic species. Here we use PCR amplification of a conserved W-chromosome-linked gene to show that the sex ratio within broods of a natural population of sexually size-monomorphic collared flycatchers Ficedula albicollis is related to the size of their father's forehead patch, a heritable secondary sexual character implicated in female choice. Experimental manipulations of paternal investment, which influence the size of this character in future breeding attempts, result in corresponding changes in the sex ratio of offspring born to males in those breeding attempts. In contrast, manipulations of maternal investment have no effect on future sex ratios, and there is no relationship between variables predicting the reproductive value of the brood and nestling sex ratio. Analysis of recruitment of offspring reveals similar patterns of sex ratio bias. The results suggest that female collared flycatchers are able to adjust the sex ratio of eggs ovulated in response to the phenotype of their mate. This finding is most consistent with 'genetic quality' models of sexual selection.","animal experiment;  article;  bird;  breeding;  evolution;  fitness;  nonhuman;  priority journal;  sex ratio;  sexual behavior;  statistical analysis, Africa;  Animals;  Birds;  Choice Behavior;  Chromosome Mapping;  Evolution;  Feathers;  Female;  Male;  Paternal Behavior;  Polymerase Chain Reaction;  Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational;  Population;  Regression Analysis;  Sex Characteristics;  Sex Ratio;  Sexual Behavior, Animal;  Sweden;  Vertebrates, Animalia;  Aves;  Ficedula albicollis;  Vertebrata",NA,NA,"Fisher, R.A., (1930) The Genetical Theory of Nutural Selection, , Oxford Univ.

Humans have been used to assess 'colour', an approach which may be flawed as many birds see in the ultraviolet (to which humans are blind), and have at least four spectral classes of retinal cone cells (humans have only three). Here we report experiments on zebra finches which test the hypothesis that the ultraviolet waveband (300-400 nm) is used in avian mate-choice decisions. We found that the ultraviolet is used, and that it probably contributes to hue perception. This finding may have wide implications for future studies of avian sexual selection and colour, and supports one hypothesized function of avian ultraviolet vision, the role of which is largely unknown.","animal experiment;  article;  bird;  color;  controlled study;  evolution;  female;  male;  mating;  nonhuman;  perception;  priority journal;  retina cone;  ultraviolet radiation;  vision, Animalia;  Aves;  Fringillidae;  Taeniopygia guttata, mate choice;  sexual selection;  ultraviolet vision;  zebra finch",NA,NA,"Darwin, C., (1871) The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex, , Murray, London; Endler, J.A., (1993) Phil Trans.

Prior to the experiment, each male founder was fitted with either two red bands (creating a phenotype previously demonstrated to be attractive to females) or two green bands (unattractive to females) as part of a unique combination of four leg bands. The overall paternal exclusion rate was 28%, as determined by multilocus, minisatellite DNA fingerprinting of 278 offspring reared by 26 males and their mates. Mean exclusion rates were 16% and 40% for red- and green-banded males, respectively. Exclusion rates were directly proportional to rates of female participation in unforced extrapair copulations (UEPCs) with red-banded males that occurred when females were fertile. Rates of fertile, forced extrapair copulations (FEPCs) and fertile UEPCs involving green-banded males either failed to influence exclusion rate or varied inversely with exclusion rate, indicating that extrapair fertilization (EPF) is under female control. Effort devoted by males to seeking EPFs increased exclusion rate. Results suggest that males place greater effort into seeking fertile versus infertile EPCs and that unattractive males accrue fitness gains through high parental investment (PI), whereas attractive males benefit through decreased PI and increased allocation to EPF.","extra-pair fertilization;  sexual selection;  zebra finch, Estrildidae;  Taeniopygia guttata",NA,NA,"Altmann, J., Observational study of behavior: Sampling methods (1974) Behaviour, 49, pp. 227-265; Birkhead, T.R., Burke, T., Zann, R.A., Hunter, F.M., Krupa, A.P., Extrapair paternity and intraspecific brood parasitism in wild zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, revealed by DNA fingerprinting (1990) Behav Ecol Sociobiol, 27, pp. 315-324; Birkhead, T.R., Hunter, F.M., Pellatt, J.E., Sperm competition in the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata (1989) Anim Behav, 38, pp. 935-950; Birkhead, T.R., Mller, A.P., (1992) Sperm Competition in Birds: Evolutionary Causes and Consequences, , London: Academic Press; Burley, N., The organization of behavior and the evolution of sexually selected traits (1985) Avian Monogamy, pp. 22-44. , (Gowaty PA, Mock DW, eds).

This experiment investigated the effect of symmetric and asymmetric arbitrary traits (arrangements of coloured leg-bands) on reproductive success in captive zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata. Six groups of six males and six females were separated into six free-flight breeding aviaries. Nestboxes and nesting material were freely available throughout the experiment. Males wore symmetric and asymmetric arrangements of the same coloured leg-bands. Each male wore two orange and two light green bands, two on each leg. There were six possible arrangements of these leg-bands. One male from each of these six leg-band treatments was present in each aviary, along with six females wearing numbered orange bands. Symmetrically banded males produced more offspring that survived past the period of parental care than males in either of the asymmetric treatments; this appeared to be the effect of female choice processes and female-based parental investment and not male intra-sexual dominance. This is the first experiment to indicate that symmetrically manipulated males gain reproductive advantages in controlled laboratory conditions and further supports recent theories indicating the evolutionary importance of symmetry in signalling-trait design.  1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","fluctuating asymmetry;  parental investment;  reproductive success;  sexual selection;  zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata",NA,"I thank Innes Cuthill, Mark Witter and Rowan Lockwood for helpful discussion concerning experimental design and for inciteful discussion; Tim Guilford and two anonymous referees for their comments on an early version of the manuscript; Anders Mller for access to unpublished manuscripts; and Rob Massie and Sadie Iles for routine daily maintenance of the birds.

Although this behaviour has been described for many species, little is yet known about the variation in mateguarding intensity between males in a population and the reason for such variation. In this study, we wanted to examine how mateguarding intensity relates to the sexual attractiveness of the male. Male bluethroats, Luscinia s. svecica, have a bright throat patch, an ornament extensively displayed during courtship. Two experiments are reported. In the first, we show that males which had their throat patch blackened (with Nyanzol D) before pairing had a lower pairing success than control males. We conclude that the blackening of the throat patch reduced male attractiveness. In the second experiment, a group of males were blackened after pairing. These males guarded their mates more closely than did control males, and spent less effort advertising for secondary mates. Thus, we conclude that a male's mateguarding intensity is flexible and negatively related to his sexual attractiveness. The mechanisms by which a male can assess the likelihood of becoming cuckolded are discussed. 1995 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","attractiveness;  bluethroat;  courtship;  mate guarding, Luscinia svecica svecica",NA,NA,"Alatalo, R.V., Gottlander, K., Lundberg, A., Extrapair copulations and mate guarding in the polyterritorial pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca (1987) Behaviour, 101, pp. 139-155; Ashcroft, R.E., A function of the pairbond in the common eider (1976) Wildfowl, 27, pp. 101-105; Beecher, M.D., Beecher, I.M., Sociobiology of bank swallows: reproductive strategy of the male (1979) Science, 205, pp. 1282-1285; Bensch, S., Hasselquist, D., Evidence for active female choice in a polygynous warbler (1992) Anim.

Half of the adults were of the fawn morph and half of the chestnut-flanked white. Seventeen young males were reared, and each tended to learn most of its song from one adult. They showed a strong tendency to learn song elements from males of the same morph as their father and, within that morph, the father tended to be the preferred tutor. Most learnt from the male with which they maintained greatest proximity. No relationship was found between song learning and the song length or singing rate of individual adults, or with various aspects of social behaviour, such as allopreening or aggression. No young bird was seen to be fed by an adult other than one of its parents; most of the young continued to associate more with their siblings than with other juveniles after independence, and there was some evidence that siblings that associated most closely developed most similar song characteristics. Differences in social relationships and in song learning from some earlier studies may stem from the greater space available in the aviaries used here.  1995.",Taeniopygia guttata,NA,This research was carried out while N.I.M.

If this secondary sexual structure is important in attracting mates or in male-male competition, then colour banding males with red or orange bands (RO) could influence their pairing and reproductive success, survival and the amount of aggression directed towards them. Males with RO bands did not have more mates than those without RO bands, nor did males unbanded in year x improve their pairing success in year x + 1 when they were given RO bands. In a female removal experiment, males with RO bands did not have more females settling on their territories than males with other band colours. Number of chicks fledged from successful nests and annual survival did not differ for RO and non-RO males. Monogamous and polygynous males had similar comb areas which were larger than the combs of unmated males. When pairing statys was controlled, comb area was not related to annual survival or number of chicks fledged. Males with RO bands did not have larger combs than non-RO males. Area of comb was correlated with territory size in years of high breeding density, but not in years of low breeding density. Radiotagged non-territorial males did not preferentially intrude upon the territories of males with RO bands and song rates, number of border disputes, mean length of border disputes, and territorial intrusion rates did not differ significantly for RO and non-RO males. These results suggest that colour-banding willow ptarmigan with red colour bands does not have a negative or positive effect on reproductive success or survival, and thus the data do not support the coverable badge hypothesis.  1995.","badge size;  comb display;  reproductive success;  willow ptarmigan, Lagopus lagopus",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,"We thank the many assistants who have assisted us over the years, especially J.

Such asymmetries are believed to be a direct indicator of phenotypic, perhaps genotypic, quality2. Relative levels of asymmetry are much greater in secondary sexual characters than in normal morphological traits2. It has been proposed that females use the amount of asymmetry in secondary sexual ornamentation as a cue in mate choice3, because the highest quality individuals have the most symmetrical, as well as elaborate, ornaments2-10. Using a choice chamber similar to that in ref. 11, we show here that female zebra finches choose symmetrically leg-banded males over asymmetrically banded ones. This demonstrates unequivocally that females use symmetry as a criterion in partner preference, although whether the symmetry preference is specific to secondary sexual characters is unknown.  1994 Nature Publishing Group.","fluctuating asymmetry;  male choice;  sexual ornamentation;  zebra finch, Fringillidae;  Taeniopygia guttata, animal experiment;  article;  assortative mating;  bird;  female;  male;  mating;  morphology;  nonhuman;  priority journal;  sexual behavior",NA,NA,"Ludwig, W., (1932) Das Rechts-Links Problem im Tiereich und beim Menschen, , (Springer, Berlin); Mller, A.P., Pomiankowski, A., Genetica; Meller, A.P., (1992) Nature, 357, pp. 238-240; Manning, J.T., Hartley, M.A., (1991) Anim.

I tested the ability of female zebra finches to discriminate among males on the basis of their past as well as current phenotype by allowing them to view groups of four males for two hours a day, for four days, while the bill colour of individual males was manipulated with orange and red paint. Four bill colour treatments were assigned to the males in a stimulus set. One male was orange for all four days, one was red for all four days, a third male was orange for the first two days but red for the second two days, and the fourth male was red for the first two days and orange for the second two days. There was a slight, but nonsignificant, preference for orange bills when compared on a day to day basis regardless of bill colour history. However, when males were ranked on day 3 and day 4 according to the proportion of the assessment period they had been orange, there was a significant positive correlation between preference on those days and proportion of time orange. A more detailed examination shows that there was an effect of bill colour history independent of current bill colour but not viceversa. These results suggest that discrimination is based not only upon instantaneous appearance, but average appearance over the assessment period. 1994 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",NA,NA,NA,"Andersson, M., Female choice selects for extreme tail length in a widow bird (1982) Nature, 299, pp. 818-820; Andersson, S., Female preference for long tails in lekking Jackson's widowbirds: Experimental evidence, Anim (1992) Behav., 43, pp. 379-388; Burley, N.T., Coopersmith, C.B., Bill colour preferences of zebra finches (1987) Ethology, 76, pp. 133-151; Burley, N.T., Krantzberg, G., Radman, P., Influence of colour banding on the conspecific preferences of zebra finches (1982) Anim.

In the first experiment, females were allowed to choose among four naturally varying males. In the second, females chose among four males wearing either orange, blue, yellow, or no color bands. In experiment 1, females performed more courtship with males that had significantly brighter bills and were brighter overall. In experiment 2, females preferred males wearing orange bands over unhanded males. Blue-banded males ranked second and yellow third, but neither was preferred significantly more often than the unbanded males. A female's preference for a particular band color was weakly associated with her own bill and plumage measures; females with brighter throat feathers and yellower bills preferred orange bands to blue bands. The results suggest that female preferences for orange and yellow may be functional and that females may also have aesthetic preferences.  1993 International Society for Behavioral Ecology.","American goldfinch;  colour;  mate preference, Carduelis tristis","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation,BSR-8800218","We thank the following people for their help in various phases of the project: J.Alster, B.

They received either all red bands (to match their epaulets) or all black bands (controls). Over half the red-banded males lost their territories while all black-banded males retained their territories. Red and black-banded males did not differ morphologically. However, among red-banded males, those that lost their territories had larger epaulets and were in poorer condition than those retaining their territories. Red-banded males suffered much higher intrusion rates, particularly by neighbors, than black-banded males. We propose that red color bands exaggerated the males' natural aggressive signal beyond the point where the signal was reliable. Our results suggest that signal reliability is maintained by regular testing, particularly of those males most likely to be signalling dishonestly.  1991 Springer-Verlag.","red-winged blackbird;  secondary sexual trait;  signal, Agelaius phoeniceus",NA,NA,"Beletsky, L.D., Orians, G.H., Red bands and red-winged blackbirds (1989) The Condor, 91, pp. 993-995; Brodsky, L.M., Ornament size influences mating success in male rock ptarmigan (1988) Anim Behav, 36, pp. 662-667; Burley, N., Sex ratio manipulation and selection for attractiveness (1981) Science, 211, pp. 721-722; Burley, N., The organization of behavior and the evolution of sexually-selected traits (1985) Avian monogamy, pp. 22-44. , P.A., Gowaty, D.W., Mock, American Ornithologists' Union, Washington DC; Burley, N., Sex-ratio manipulation in color-banded populations of zebra finches (1986) Evolution, 40, pp. 1191-1206; Burley, N., Sexual selection for aesthetic traits in species with biparental care (1986) The American Naturalist, 127, pp. 415-445; Burley, N., Krantzberg, G., Radman, P., Influence of colour-banding on the conspecific preferences of zebra finches (1982) Anim Behav, 30, pp. 444-455; Butcher, G.S., Rohwer, S., The evolution of conspicuous and distinctive coloration for communication in birds (1988) Current ornithology, vol 6, pp. 51-108. , D.M., Power, Plenum Press, New York; Darwin, C., (1871) The descent of man and selection in relation to sex, , Murray, London; Eckert, C.G., Weatherhead, P.J., Owners, floaters and competitive asymmetries among territorial red-winged blackbirds (1987) Anim Behav, 35, pp. 1317-1323; Eckert, C.G., Weatherhead, P.J., Ideal dominance distributions: a test using red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) (1987) Behav Ecol Sociobiol, 20, pp. 43-52; Freeman, S., Male red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) assess the RHP of neighbors by watching contests (1987) Behav Ecol Sociobiol, 21, pp. 307-311; Hagan, J.M., Reed, J.M., Red color bands reduce fledging success in red-cockaded woodpeckers (1988) Auk, 105, pp. 498-503; Hansen, A.J., Rohwer, S., Coverable badges and resource defence in birds (1986) Anim Behav, 34, pp. 69-76; Morris, L., Effect of blackened epaulets on the territorial behavior and breeding success of male redwinged blackbirds, Agelaius phoeniceus (1975) Ohio J Sci, 75, pp. 168-176; Nero, R.W., A behavior study of the red-winged blackbird.
